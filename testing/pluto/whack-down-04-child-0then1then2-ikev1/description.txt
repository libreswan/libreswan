an IKE only connection, that has 2 Child SAs from other connections

- establish IKE, then 1 and 2
  abuse revival to make the connection childless

- down IKE
  because there are children it should not be
  deleted

- down 1

- down 2

  because IKE is down with no children it should self destruct
  (hint it currently doesn/t)

- re-down IKE

Basic pluto with IKEv2 using PSK on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

Identical to ikev2-algo-ike-sha2-03, but now we use ike=aes128-sha2_256 instead of aes-sha2_256

In older versions of libreswan (around 2013) this would give the following error:

| proposal 1 failed encr= (policy:aes-cbc vs offered:aes-cbc)
|             succeeded integ=(policy:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 vs offered:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128)
|             succeeded prf=  (policy:prf-hmac-sha2-256 vs offered:prf-hmac-sha2-256)
|             succeeded dh=   (policy:OAKLEY_GROUP_MODP1536 vs offered:OAKLEY_GROUP_MODP1536)
| proposal 1 failed encr= (policy:aes-cbc vs offered:aes-cbc)
|             succeeded integ=(policy:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 vs offered:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128)
|             succeeded prf=  (policy:prf-hmac-sha2-256 vs offered:prf-hmac-sha2-256)
|             failed dh=   (policy:OAKLEY_GROUP_MODP1024 vs offered:OAKLEY_GROUP_MODP1536)
| complete v2 state transition with (null)
| state transition function for STATE_PARENT_I1 failed: NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN

note the first proposal would match fully but the encr= would say "failed"

This issue was resolved and this test remains to confirm there is no regression.

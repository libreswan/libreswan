Basic pluto with IKEv2 using PSK on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

Identical to ikev2-algo-ike-sha2-03, but now we use ike=aes128-sha2_256 instead of aes-sha2_256

This (as of writing) gives the following error:

| proposal 1 failed encr= (policy:aes-cbc vs offered:aes-cbc)
|             succeeded integ=(policy:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 vs offered:AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128)

| complete v2 state transition with (null)

note the first proposal fully matches but the encr= says "failed"

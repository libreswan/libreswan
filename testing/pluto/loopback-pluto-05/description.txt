Using netkey and the looopback feature, pluto connects to itself for an SA.
This is used for MLS type labeling of connections on the same host

This tests whether priorities are honoured properly when multiple loopback
connections are in use. We install a wide policy and check it is getting
encrypted. Then we install a narrow passthrough policy on top and see if
we properly send unencrypted

It uses a weird track where 127.0.0.XXX works for any XXX so we can use these
as markers in the tcpdump - they also are not encrypted because its not 127.0.0.1

openswan fails this test because it does not properly prioritize passthrough connections ?

;
; This is a minimal sample l2tpd configuration file for use
; with L2TP over IPsec.
;
; The idea is to provide an L2TP daemon to which remote Windows L2TP/IPsec
; clients connect. In this example, the internal (protected) network
; is 192.168.1.0/24.  A special IP range within this network is reserved
; for the remote clients: 192.168.1.128/25
; (i.e. 192.168.1.128 ... 192.168.1.254)
;
; The listen-addr parameter can be used if you want to bind the L2TP daemon
; to a specific IP address instead of to all interfaces. For instance,
; you could bind it to the interface of the internal LAN (e.g. 192.168.1.98
; in the example below). Yet another IP address (local ip, e.g. 192.168.1.99)
; will be used by l2tpd as its address on pppX interfaces.

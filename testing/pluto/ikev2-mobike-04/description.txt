IKEv2 mobike initiator support. road is the initiator, like closing and opening the lid.

Road has one IP addresses when at the start. Establish IPsec tunnel.
Remove the ip adddress. Pluto will detect address change
and, fail to find an alternative source adddress.

Later add the same address back. It should still initiate MOBIKE exchange.
The responder may see NAT change, or just port change

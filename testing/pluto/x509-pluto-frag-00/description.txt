Basic pluto X.509 test but now west and east are dropping UDP packets >
1500 (tried dropping fragments but linux outsmarts us) and our policies
forbid IKE fragmentation. The CERT payload is causing an IKE payload of
more then 1500 bytes, so the UDP packet will be lost.

As a result, this connection should fail to establish. This serves as
a basis for our IKE fragmentation tests that work around the issue of
routers dropping UDP fragments.

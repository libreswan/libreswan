This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses RSASIG to authenticate for phase 1.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5. East is uses password based XAUTH
using /etc/ipsec.d/passwd

It then proceeds to phase 2.

(see -04 for a case where aggressive mode is used)


This test case confirms that XAUTH without ModeCFG does not end up with a
partial PHASE 1 state. libreswan up to 3.21 suffered from this bug.

KLIPS test for passthrough of a single port

A standard westnet-eastnet IPsec SA is established. A passthrough IPsec SA is
setup for port 22 with. Packets for port 22 SHOULD NOT be encrypted with IPsec.
Packets for port 222 SHOULD be encrypted with IPsec

This test case passes the policy checks within KLIPS, but seems to miss a route
and so unencrypted packets might be going out eth0 instead of eth1????

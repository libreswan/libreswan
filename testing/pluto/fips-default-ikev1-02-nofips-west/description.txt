pluto RSA test with east in FIPS mode using default IKE parameters and IKEv1

East is in FIPS mode, west makes a default proposal.

This test requires compilation with USE_FIPSCHECK=true
This test fakes the kernel being in FIPS mode
This test uses NSS modutil to put NSS explicitely in FIPS mode

This test also uses plutodebug=all,private to test that private does not
break things (we cannot access key material to log via private calls)

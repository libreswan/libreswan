Basic certificate testcase, but now the CA is deleted and both ends
have to validate each other purely based on having each other's
certificate preloaded.

Additionally, an unrelated CA at all is loaded to test the situation
where west does have at least one CA, but not the right CA. Since the
certificates are hardcoded using leftcert= and rightcert=, the connection
should establish, despite the lack of valid CA.

This is an IKEv2, insist, test using X509 certs on the initiator (road), and on the responder(east). It has two connections, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 has leftsubnets and IPv6 has a subnet and rekey timers are short. 

Though, the rekey timers are short autmatic runs don't wait that long. If you want to rekeying run the test manually.

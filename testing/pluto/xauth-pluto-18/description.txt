This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

As xauth-pluto-12 but now we also attempt to rekey which should not require
a password. And we use remote_peer_type=cisco to activate that code path

this test also uses NAT.

libreswan < 3.6 crashes on this test, see lsbz#148

It also seems libreswan does not act the same as a Cisco peer, so this connection
ends up without a proper IPsec SA installed if a workaround for lsbz#148 is used,
regardless of IPsec stack used - it happens on KLIPS as well as NETKEY.

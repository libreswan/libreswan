mixed deployment OE

In this case both east and road allow AUTHNULL and only the
initiator allows (and starts with) authenticated.

This tests places road in the clear-or-private group on east,
otherwise east responds with initiating an anon OE connection
without road getting a change to try its fallback policy.

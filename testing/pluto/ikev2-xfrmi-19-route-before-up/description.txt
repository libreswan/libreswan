A routed host-to-host a.k.a. /32-to-/32 tunnel using xfrmi interface on road.

This test checks that the XFRM interface is created correctly before routing the tunnel.

xfrmi need CONFIG_XFRM_INTERFACE=y in the kernel.

This also tests the normally unused ipsec0 device.

road will have device ipsec0
ip rule show
ip route show table 50
ip -s link show ipsec0


it also tests if delete works, as it needs to specify the if_id as well

Using a single VTI device for all incoming roadwarriors on a connection

Currently hits a VTI problem on east, which can be seen by the 100% packet
loss of the ping on road. tcpdump shows the ping is encrypted, decrypted
and replied to but never makes it out of east encrypted. The route is
properly going into the VTI device....

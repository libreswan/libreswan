Test corrupt SK payloads in an AUTH packet

Both east and west inject a corrupted AUTH packet, followed by a
correct AUTH packet into their packet processor.

The first packet triggers the SKEYSEED calculation, but, when that
finishes fails to decrypt so is dropped.  The second packet is
decrypted successfully (SKEYSEED is not recomputed) and the connection
can establish.

OE AUTHNULL test with failureshunt=passthrough

this test is similar to newoe-4 except now east has no OE connections
loaded at all. IKE responses will be NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

road will attempt IKE, fail and a passthrough shunt should be installed.

Both negotiationshunt and failureshunt are passthrough so no packet loss
should happen.

note1: the shunt status at the beginning should show a shunt but it does not?
       This needs to be explained/fixed?

note2: Also because we don't replace identical failureshunt with negotiationshunt
       the "why" is listed as "oe-failing" instead of "oe-failed".

Basic pluto with IKEv2 using X.509 on the responder (east), and Strongswan on
the initiator (west).

This tests libreswan as server accepting rsa-sha1 (v1.5) and rsa-sha2 (PSS)

unfortunately, strongswan without rsa_pss = true in strongswan.conf will response
with rsa-sha2 (v1.5)

However, it indicates an unfixable problem. How to migrate strongswan rsa-sha1 clients
to rsa-sha2. strongswan does not support on-the-fly decisions on RSA v1.5 vs RSA PSS
and libreswan does not support RSA v1.5 for all new style RFC 7427 digital signature
methods as dictated by RFC 8247.

We might be biased, but believe strongswan should fix their code :)

This test therefore fails and is marked wip (maybe should be marked bug)

This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses RSASIG to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.

It then proceeds to phase 2.

No ModeConfig is used with this test. This should confirm a fix for rhbz#841325

This test case confirms that XAUTH without ModeCFG does not end up with a
partial PHASE 1 state. libreswan up to 3.21 suffered from this bug.

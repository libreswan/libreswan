A road warrior, ("road":initiator) connecting to east(responder) 
using Main Mode + XAUTH. 

the conction will fail to establish due to
ipsec whack --debug-all --impair drop-xauth-r0 

road will drop XAUTH_R0 (User/Password request) from east. 
East will try to retransmit on its own first. 
ie. east will send STATE_MAIN_R3 + STATE_XAUTH_R0(re-created)

Road will retransmit the previous main mode request

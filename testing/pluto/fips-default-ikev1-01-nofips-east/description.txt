pluto RSA test with west in FIPS mode using default IKE parameters and IKEv1

East is in default mode, allowing for test of FIPS-only proposals by west

This test uses NSS modutil to put NSS explicitly in FIPS mode

This test also uses plutodebug=all,private to test that private does not
break things (we cannot access key material to log via private calls)

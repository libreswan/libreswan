lsw#299 test

Two road warriors, north and road connect to east, IKEv1, xauth authby=secret.
East use addresspool and xauth passwd file for IPv4 address asignment.

note: Sometimes a retransmit causes this test to fail. While the tunnels are
setup, retranmissions trigger a failure and tunnels are brought down despite
that they were working. So suddenly, north's ping's fail.
Adding a slow retransmits (as per comments in the *conf files), works around this issue

Basic pluto test with seccomp enabled.

Once established and disconnected, we run the seccomp
test to confirm pluto died.

If this test shows mangled output, it means a cryptohelper
was shot - pluto still lives - and it managed to continue.
That should be considered a bug.

The only SECCOMP entry that should show up in the audit log is
the one for set_sid, (currently 124 but could change over time)

Use /usr/bin/scmp_sys_resolver to match number -> name

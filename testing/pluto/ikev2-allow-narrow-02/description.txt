Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

Per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7296#section-2.9 (Traffic Selector
Negotiation) this test checks to see if the responder accepts a more
narrowed down proposal.

The initiator, configured with narrowing=no and a traffic selector
specifying all protocols and ports, requests a CHILD SA.

The responder, configured with narrowing=yes and a traffic selector
specifying all protocols but only port 1234, responds with a narrowed
response.

Because the initiator has narrowing=no, it should reject the CHILD_SA.

Per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7296#section-2.21.2 (Error Handling
in IKE_AUTH):

- the initiator authenticates the responder

  If that fails the response can't be trusted and the IKE SA is
  deleted using a further exchange, a new IKE SA can then be
  initiated.

  Here, this should succeed.

- the initiator checks the CHILD SA response

  If that fails the child sa is deleted using a further exchange, the
  IKE SA may also be deleted based on policy.

  XXX: Not sure what pluto is doing; it isn't this.

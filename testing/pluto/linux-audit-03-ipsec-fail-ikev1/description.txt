NETKEY based test to verify AUDIT messages are logged by the kernel
for service startup and shutdown and IKE SA's and IPSEC SA's events.

This test MUST run with selinux enabled or else the selinux labels in
the audit log are different (eg unconfined). Since some have configured
test VMs with /etc/sysconfig/selinux disabled, force it in this test.

This test is for failure cases only. Note that IKEv1 does not perform
proper state changes on IKEv1 failures - so LAK_PARENT_FAIL calls
cannot be placed inside complete_v1_state_transition()

IKEv1 retransmits for QUICK MODE with keyingtries=1 do this more then
1 time, so more then one CRYPTO_IPSEC op=start res=failed is logged
per connection.

IKEv2 causes a simultaneous failure of IKE SA and IPsec SA, because
we don't properly support childless SA and we don't keep the IKE SA
when the IPsec SA fails, which we should. So logging for these is
a bit inconsistent. Once we properly keep the IKE SA on Child SA
failures, logging should be fixed as well.

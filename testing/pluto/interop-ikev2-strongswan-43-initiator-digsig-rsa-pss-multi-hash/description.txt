Basic pluto with IKEv2 using X.509 on the responder (east), and Strongswan on
the initiator (west).

This is the reverse test of interop-ikev2-strongswan-04-x509-responder

This is the basic test for Authentication method as Digital Signatures as 
specified in RFC 7427. Currently supported for RSA-PSS as per RFC8427.

This includes a new notification of type SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS.

This test case negotiates SHA2_512, SHA2_384 and SHA_256 in the hash algorithm notification.
When more than one hash algorithm is negotiated, we authenticate in the order of
rsa-sha2_512,rsa-sha2_384,rsa-sha2_256.

In this case Digital signature authentication is successful through rsa-sha2_512

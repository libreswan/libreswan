east and west both have two certs/conns loaded. west initiates
one connection as normal. West is then crashed/restarted, to
emulate another client from the same IP using a different cert/conn
to match the different conn on east. The connection should establish.
On east, there should be two conns established.

Note: this might not fully reproduce the situation where this causes
a problem.

Test for ikev1 delete/notify send from responder.

This test uses auto=start on east and auto=add on west,
so that west can become the "responder" to send the --down
command.

This test brings up two connections, then we send a delete
for "first" one. Ideally, the ISAKMP SA should not be
terminated as it is used for the second connection.

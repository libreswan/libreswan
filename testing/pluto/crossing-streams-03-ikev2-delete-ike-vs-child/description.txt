one end deletes IKE SA and the other deletes the Child SA simultaneously

- west initiates delete but its outbound message is blocked
- east initiates delete
- west blocks east's inbound delete

At this point both ends think they are the one deleting.

- west sends it's blocked delete request
- west receives east's blocked delete request

Since things are still +UP, revival should occur.

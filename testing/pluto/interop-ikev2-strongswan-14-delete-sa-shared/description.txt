This tests processing a DELETE request from strongswan interop

This test is WIP, because it seems strongswan is broken. If you
send a delete for a connection with shared IKE SA, it will
actually delete the IKE SA and not the IPsec SA. So we cannot
confirm that we properly receive the IPsec SA delete and reply
with a DELETE payload and not an empty INFORMATIONAL payload.

Test unknown (bogus) payloads in an SA_INIT exchange.

Both east and west include unknown payloads in their SA_INIT packets.

The first exchange uses unknown (but non-critical payloads) so the
connection establishes.

The second exchange has west sending an unknown critical payload, so
east responds with UNSUPPORTED_CRITICAL_PAYLOAD, and the connection
quickly times out.

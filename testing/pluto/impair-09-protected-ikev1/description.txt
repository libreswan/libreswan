IKEv1 with corrupt integrity - i.e., the HASH paload

West initiates a series of SAs where all but the very first have the
integrity hash of one of the exchanges corrupted.  When east receives
the corrupt message it is expected to either discard or ignore packet.

In the case of a delete or notify, the corrupt exchange only occurs
after the SA has established (so don't use the SA establishing as an
indicator that things are broken).

Since all the interesting stuff happens on east - that is the place to
look.  At the end of the test, east's messages are dumped and then
checked against expectations.

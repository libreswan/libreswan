This is an AES key size test to confirm conformance with RFC 3602 Section 5.3:

5.3. Key Length Attribute


   Since the AES allows variable key lengths, the Key Length attribute
   MUST be specified in both a Phase 1 exchange [IKE] and a Phase 2
   exchange [DOI].

We use ike=aes-sha1 and esp=aes-sha1

Current behaviour is expected to be: 

1) allow aes128, aes192 and aes256 on the receiver
2) use 128 on the sender (it's the only mandatory to implement key size)

Previous behaviour was that for esp= we defaulted to 256 bit and for ike= we didn't sent and key length (and we took that ourselves as to mean 128)

Future behaviour should be to send 3 proposals instead of one, so this specification
becomes symmetrial and will not break when initiator/responder roles switch during
rekey when only one end specfies a specific key length.

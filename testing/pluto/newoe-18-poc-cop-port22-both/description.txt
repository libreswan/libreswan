An OE connection only covering tcp port 22 to east. This one is
configured for both incoming and outgoing port 22. This tests
if the priorities of protoport OE connections get the right
values.

(we use 22 so we can echo something and get closed connection)

See newoe-18-poc-cop-port22-both-reorder where the order of clear-or-private
entries is reversed, and east has to switch connections in IKE_AUTH

Test case using left=%any without specifying leftid on east.

This is expected to match any ID_IPv4 value.

This check is done on the instantiated template (where c->spd.that.host_addr
is already filled in with the instance IP) by checking this->host_type == KH_ANY

A minor issue is that the ipsec status output shows "their id" as the IP of their
NAT gateway, instead of the pre-NAT IP ID payload the client behind NAT actually
sent.

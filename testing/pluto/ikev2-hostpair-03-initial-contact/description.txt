IKEv2 host-to-host with NAT and CP.

ikev2-hostpair-01 reconnects using the same IP, without sending any
deletes. It does this 4 times. Since it sends Initial Contact,
there should be no duplicate (old) IPsec SA states on east, and only
one complete set of in/out/fwd policy rules.

kev2-hostpair-02 does NOT use Initial Contact and does end up with
multiple old lingering states.

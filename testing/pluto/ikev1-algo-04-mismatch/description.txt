Basic pluto with IKEv1 using PSK on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

This is to verify we don't setup an ESP with with incompatible algo / hash sizes.
In libreswan-3.9, an 3des<->aes mismatched ESP proposal caused an SA to be setup
with the initiator proposal instead of being rejected.

We use an impair function to fail quickly without retransmits.

this uses netkey for no particular reason

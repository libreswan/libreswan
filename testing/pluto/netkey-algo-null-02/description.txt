Unsupported alg pluto test:

"westnet-eastnet": 192.0.1.0/24===192.1.2.45[@west]...192.1.2.23[@east]===192.0.2.0/24

The policy has been adjusted to request NULL with SHA1 for  phase 2.

When using KLIPS, this apparently crashes pluto. This is bug #890

The parameter "null" is apparently not evaluated and libreswan tries to
generate a key with length 0. This is not a valid length value. The error
message is: "Trouble building pfkey message, error=22"

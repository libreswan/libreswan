This test will show that multiple IPSECKEY records all end up in the
pluto cache. 

The connection is testing east on custom ip 192.1.2.67, which has zero
correct IPSECKEY records. The connection should NOT establish.

On failure of AUTH, initiator _should_ send a DELETE so that east, who
thinks everything is okay, will also delete its tunnel

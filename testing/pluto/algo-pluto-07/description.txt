Unsupported alg pluto test:

The policy has been adjusted to request SHA2 for phase 2, which is supported
by NETKEY, but not by KLIPS. [PAUL: not true with cryptoapi?]

When using NETKEY, this crashed pluto. This is openswan bug #496 (of old mantis tracker)

The "4096" is bogus and we should fail to load this conn.

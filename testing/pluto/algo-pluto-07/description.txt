Unsupported alg pluto test:

east is unused. west will test various kind of illegal configurations
to see they get properly rejected. Currenly lists one test:

esp=aes256-sha2_256-4096

When using NETKEY, this crashed pluto. This is openswan bug #496 (of old mantis tracker)
The "4096" is bogus and we should fail to load this conn.

Unsupported alg pluto test:

The policy has been adjusted to request SHA2 for phase 2, which is supported
by NETKEY, but not by KLIPS. [PAUL: not true with cryptoapi?]

When using NETKEY, this apparently crashes pluto. This is bug #496

PAUL: The "4096" seems bogus and we ignore it (should we even load it?)
      However, connection 'works' and no crash ???

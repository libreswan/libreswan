x509 test for the delivery of intermediate CA chains.
sendca=all for the full chain

west has the chain:

west_chain_root ->
west_chain_intermediate_1 ->
west_chain_intermediate_2 ->
west_chain_intermediate_3 ->
west_chain_endcert

I also has east's root ca: east_chain_root

east has the chain:

east_chain_root ->
east_chain_intermediate_1 ->
east_chain_intermediate_2 ->
east_chain_intermediate_3 ->
east_chain_endcert

It also has west's root ca: west_chain_root

Upon a CR the host delivers the CERT payloads for the endcert and
intermediates 1, 2, and 3. The chain is verified by the peer down to
the host's chain_root.

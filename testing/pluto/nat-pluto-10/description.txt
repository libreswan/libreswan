This is a test of NAT-traversal. It also uses X.509 certificates for
authentication.

This is identical to nat-pluto-01 except that it specifies BOTH
rightca=%same and leftca=%same on both ends. Older version of libreswan
did not ignore the leftca on left and the rightca on right and the
connection would fail to establish

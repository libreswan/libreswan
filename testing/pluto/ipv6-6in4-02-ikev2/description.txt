IPv6 over IPv4 (both sides NETKEY):

"westnet-eastnet-6in4": 2001:db8:0:1::/64===192.1.2.45<192.1.2.45>[@west]...192.1.2.23<192.1.2.23>[@east]===2001:db8:0:2::/64

1) west ping6's from its westnet ip to the eastnet ip
2) west adds an ip6table rule to block plaintext from eastnet
3) west pings again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) west initiates connection "westnet-eastnet-6in4"; east responds
5) west ping6's from its westnet ip to the eastnet ip

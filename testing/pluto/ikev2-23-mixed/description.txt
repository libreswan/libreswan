This is an IKEv2 and IKEv1 test. Two connections between the same end points road-east. One with ikev=insist and the other ikev2=never. It use X509 certs on the initiator (road), and on the responder(east).

If the connections get added and brought up as in the scripts,
it is observed that conn with ikev2=insist get established with ikev1. 

if we change the oreder of add and up there will be two connections.

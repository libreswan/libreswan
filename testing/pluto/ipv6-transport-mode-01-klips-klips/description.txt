Basic pluto test using IPv6 (and KLIPS):

This is a host-host connection using transport mode

1) west ping6's from its public ip to the east public ip
2) west adds an ip6table rule to block icmp
3) west pings again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) west initiates connection "v6-transport"; east responds
5) icmp packets flow from west to east and are not dropped when encrypted

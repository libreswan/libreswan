RFC 7427:
Basic pluto with IKEv2 using X.509 on the initiator (west), and Strongswan on
the responder (east) using Digital Signature Authentication.

This is the reverse test of interop-ikev2-strongswan-05

By default the Authentication method now is Digital Signatures.
We currently supoort RSA-PSS with SHA2 (SHA2_256,SHA2_384 and SHA2_512)

This testcase tests the auth scheme with rsa-sha2 (rsa-sha2_256)

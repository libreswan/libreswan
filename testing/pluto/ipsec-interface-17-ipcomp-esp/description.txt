Tunnel using ipsec-interface, ESP+IPCOMP, and kernel's default marks.

Because this test is subnet-to-subnet and the other end is not inside
the 'subnet' we do not need any specific 'ip rule' lookups here.  Just
add route to the subnet via dev ipsec0

Also note that the kernel state shows output marks even though they
are not necessary:

- because that end's IP address is outside the extruded subnet,
  there's no routing loop and hence, no marks are needed

however:

- even though the test's config file does not specify marks, and the
  XFRMI code passes no marks to the kernel, the kernel still feels the
  need to add them, hence the presence of output marks

Note: unsure why "proto 4" in output of ipsec _kernel state

Basic pluto X.509 test from x509-pluto-01, but now
road has ike_frag=force set so it should send out MAIN_I3
in fragments on the first run, but as east has no fragmentation
support enabled, the missing FRAGMENTATION support vendorid
should cause road to not use fragmentation.

It will show up as one less packet blocked in the firewall
compared to x509-pluto-frag-01

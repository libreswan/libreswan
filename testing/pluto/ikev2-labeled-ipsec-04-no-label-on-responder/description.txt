As ikev2-labeled-ipsec-01/childless but now the responder is not using labels

The connection should fail:

- because the initiator has a label and no acquire, it sends an IKE_SA
  but no child

- responder authenticates, but seeing no child, rejects the connection
  with AUTHENTICATION_FAILED (a little lie)

- initiator abandons  SA

TODO: responder should keep the IKE SA and only return TS_UNACCEPTABLE.

IKEv2 X.509 exchange, but with pluto under gdb

This specific test sets up two breakpoints on PR_Lock()

  #1 just continue (so the call is traced)

  #2 backtrace and then continue (so each call gets a stack backtrace)

Initially, the first breakpoint is enabled.  But when IKE_AUTH starts,
things switch to the second breakpoint.

The result is all PR_Lock() calls being traced with IKE_AUTH traced in
great detail.

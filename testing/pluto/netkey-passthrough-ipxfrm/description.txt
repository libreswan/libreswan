one connections and a specific passthrough created using ip xfrm policy command 
In this case we pick ports symmetrically using 222 <-> 222

ip xfrm policy should have priority lower than that of created by pluto. create in out and fwd polcy.

to verify using tcpdump 
tcpdump -s 0  -A -r ./OUTPUT/swan12.pcap port 222 | grep PLAIN

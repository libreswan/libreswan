Interop IKE crypto-suites with pluto initiator and strongswan responder.

Try different IKE crypto suites (algorithm combinations) with pluto as
the initiator and strongswan as the responder.

This test was updated to use sha2 instead of md5 as strongswan now also
no longer has md5 in its default proposal list.

Test unknown (bogus) payloads in an AUTH exchange.

Both east and west include unknown payloads in their AUTH packets.

The first exchange uses unknown (but non-critical payloads) so the
connection establishes (and their presence is logged).

The second exchange has west sending an unknown critical payload, so
east discards it, and the connection quickly times out.

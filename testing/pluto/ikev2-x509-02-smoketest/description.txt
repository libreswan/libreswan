IKEv2 NSS X509 test with various bits and flags toggled.

Note: dist_certs.py cannot generate some bogus certs because the
underlying openssl is refusing to generate those bogus certs. We need
another tool for those.

certificate names (files) ending with "-bad" are supposed to fail
validation. All others are supposed to succeed using the NSS IPsec
profile.

East always presents a proper certificate and uses %any for west so
that instantiation and followed Notify/Delete causes the instances to
clean up without conflicting.  (using the regular IP for west, any
second conn will fail. This is being copied to another test case to
resolve)

The certificate CN encdoes what non-standard operation was done on it:

-eku-	non-standard Key Usage specified (otherwise it contains serverAuth,clientAuth
-ekuBOGUS- set a bogus EKU OID
-ekuOmit- don't include an Extended Key Usage section
-ekuEmpty- include empty Extended Key Usage section [refused to be generated by openssl, not tested]
-ekuCritical  make EKU section Critical

Current status:

Of those that we could generate with openssl:
   All validate according to the NSS IPsec profile, except:
       west-ekuCritical fails NSS IPsec profile but passes via fallback of TLS Client profile
       west-ekuCritical-eku-emailProtection fails NSS IPsec profile, TLS Client profile and TLS Server profile

basic test with esp=null-md5

Testcase for Mantis #428 "KLIPS NULL encryption patch (through cryptoapi)"
003 "westnet-eastnet-null": requested kernel enc ealg_id=11 not present
003 "westnet-eastnet-null": can not initiate: no acceptable kernel algorithms loaded

(klips seems broken for null encryption via cryptoapi)

IKEv2 Mismatched authentication on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

Responder is configured as
leftauthby=null 	leftid=%null
rightauth=rsasig 	rightid="%fromcert"

Initiator is configured with symmetric auth
authby=null
leftid="%null"
rightid="%fromcert"

This test should not establish a connection. The initiator should reject it.

Also, the initiator should REALLY send an encrypted informational to DELETE
the conn, as east has it as established. Current output does not reflect the
delete confirmation yet.

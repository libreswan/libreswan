This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses PSK to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It then uses MODECFG to configure the phase 2, in server push mode.
It then sends DNS servers and domains using modecfgdns1,modecfgdn2
and modecfg_domain.

NOTE: Some clients require that for these messages IV from phase2, not phase1
is used. We need to turn that into an option.

It then proceeds to phase 2.

road tests to see if its resolv.conf is overwritten and restored properly

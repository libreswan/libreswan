The network is configured as follows:

    NORTH--NIC---EAST

East does not have north's certificate cached. East will send a CR to north, 
and north will transmit its certificate to east via nic. 
East has to set "leftca=" so that it will know which CA to ask for.

East specifies a peer ID wildcard for CN and E. 
NIC serves as a simple router between NORTH and EAST.

The simple test is to connect the POLE and SUNRISE networks
together. This is tested with a ping, a la "basic-pluto-03"

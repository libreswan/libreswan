Test X509 certificates with a non-empty EKU section with critical
flag set. This fails verification on NSS 3.41 using the IPsec profile,
and requires working fallback to the NSS TLS profile for verification.

This is identical to ikev2-x509-26-criticalflag, except we ALSO do not set
serverAuth, so we only have clientAuth we can use to pass verification.

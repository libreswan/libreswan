The responder has %any connection. ID send are IP_ADDR type.
The responder accepts IDi, forward IP address.
It query the reverse zone for IDi's IPSECKEY Resource Record.

North is the initiator, send its IP address as IDi.

East should lookup this record
33.3.1.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA. 10 IN IPSECKEY 10 0 2 . AQPl33

The north should lookup 
23.2.1.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA. 604800 IN IPSECKEY 10 0 2 . AQO9

This will work without NAT. 
With nat it could harder to get matching reverse zone.

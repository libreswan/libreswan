As ikev2-labeled-ipsec-01/childless but initiator is not using lables

The connection should fail:

- because initiator has no label it tries to bring
  up an IKE SA with both IKE and Child

- responder authenticates (returns its own proof); but then rejects
  child because TS (label) doesn't match

- initiator authenticates, but then because its first child wasn't
  created, it tears down the IKE SA

Basic pluto test:

"westnet-eastnet": 192.0.1.0/24===192.1.2.45[@west]...192.1.2.23[@east]===192.0.2.0/24

Two connections are defined, with different phase2 auth algorithm. Ideally, both connections
should not be allowed to get loaded. Less ideally, they should still both work by pluto picking
the right one. Curently, one of these will fail when it hits the 'other' connection.

Hugh: as long as IKE is identical, we could allow both. just that coding of this is hard

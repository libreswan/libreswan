IKEv1 specifying an ike line with aes-sha2_384 and an esp line of esp=aes

On some versions this combination esp+ike line caused the inbound and outbound
IPsec SA keys (not IKE keys) to be identical ???

A change in the ike= line, eg aes-sha2_256 "fixes" the ESP issue on those compiles - for no apparent reason?

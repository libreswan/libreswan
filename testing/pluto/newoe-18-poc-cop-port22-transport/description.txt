An OE connection only covering tcp port 22 to east

(we use 22 so we can echo something and get closed connection)

Now using transport mode to test whether we still properly pick
up the port numbers, as with tunnel mode these reside in the "client"
(subnet) defnition and for transport mode the "client" values are not used.

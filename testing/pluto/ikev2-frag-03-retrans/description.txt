Spray east with retransmitted fragments; it should re-transmit the AUTH response once

East is impaired with replay-forward.  This causes all early packets
to be replayed before processing the new packet.

Consequently, before processing the delete informational, east will
see replay of the AUTH request fragments.  This causes east to
retransmit of the AUTH response fragments (but only once).

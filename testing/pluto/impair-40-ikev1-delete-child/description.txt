This is a test for CVE-2023-38712.

send a message that contains two IKEv1 ISAKMP SA deletes

Pluto, even after the first delete ISAKMP SA had been processed and
the ISAKMP SA deleted, would try to stumble on and process the second
delete (similar, but not identical to an earlier bug where notifies
were processed after the ISAKMP SA was deleted).

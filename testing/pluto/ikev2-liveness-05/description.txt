liveness test with west using narrowing=yes, causing instantiation.

west will install a %trap for the TEMPLATE connection.
Not for the narrowed one.

Trap will be installed only if the connection can be oriented.


NOTE 2017-10-21:
West is brought up with --up, so we would expect any failure of the phase2
to cause phase1 to try and setup a tunnel again. What instead happens is
that phase2 is dead and removed, which seems to trigger a phase1 down as well
without triggering a new action to initiate

An OE connection only covering tcp port 22 to east. This one is
configured for both incoming and outgoing port 22. This tests
if the priorities of protoport OE connections get the right
values.

(we use 22 so we can echo something and get closed connection)

Compared to newoe-18-poc-cop-port22-both, the order of the clear-or-private
policies on east is reversed. This causes east to initiately pick the
wrong clear-or-private group to instantiate, and it needs to switch
during IKE_AUTH

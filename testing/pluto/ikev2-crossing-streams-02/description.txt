both sides have auto=start

one connection comes up. One end restarts and sends Delete.
The other end gets delete but revives.

what needs to be avoided is:

Because now two sets of Child SA states, using the same single set of SPD policies. But one of the set of states uses a
different / wrong crypto key?

the core problem is:

Mar  1 03:45:01.483735: "conn7" #2364: suppressing retransmit because IKE SA was superseded #2365 try=1; drop this negotiation
Mar  1 03:45:01.483774: "conn7" #2364: deleting state (STATE_PARENT_I1) aged 32.027378s and NOT sending notification

This seems to not just delete pluto state, but also kernel/policy ? So then we get an acquire, which negotiates a duplicate state
causing state/policy confusion?

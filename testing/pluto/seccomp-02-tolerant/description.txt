Basic pluto test with seccomp enabled.

Once established and disconnected, we run the seccomp
test. In tolerant mode, pluto will tell us what happened,
but continue.

The only SECCOMP entry that should show up in the audit log is
the one for set_sid, (currently 124 but could change over time)

Use /usr/bin/scmp_sys_resolver to match number -> name

The test currently shows:

	003 ERROR: pluto seccomp was tolerant but the rogue syscall was not blocked!

This is a little unexpected and depends on the return code of the
syscall, getsid() - since it got intercepted by SECCOMP, it is expected
to return a failure, but it does not. This is likely a seccomp artifact.

Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west).

This test does not actually do IKEv2, it just *tries*.

The responder (east) does not speak IKEv2 (has been told not to)
and it replies with an invalid version.  The initiator must fall
back to IKEv1.

Additionally, we shutdown pluto to get a leak report for all these rare events

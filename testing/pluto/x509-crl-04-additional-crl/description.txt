A test should be written using another CA that has two CRL distribution points of which the first one is dead.

Likely the best way of doing this is adding two CRL distributionpoints to our mainca. The first being
nic.testing.libreswan.org and the second being nictest.testing.libreswan.org. Then all tests remain
using only the first one. For this specific test, modify /etc/hosts to break "nic" and make "nictest"
point to nic's IP. Then check if CRL handling still works.

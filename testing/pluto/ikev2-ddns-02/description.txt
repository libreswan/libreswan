This tests the (oddly designed) EVENT_PENDING_DDNS

- load a connection with an unresolvable name
- once loaded, fix so the name resolves
- wait and a minute later the connection will initiate

This test differs in that the underlying resolving finds
the entry via a DNS server on localhost instead of via
/etc/hosts (ttoaddr uses gethostbyname which goes via
/etc/hosts before doing DNS via /etc/resolv.conf)

Scaffolding test case for testing VPN system roles

east and west use an include directory from OUTPUT/
for *.conf and *.secrets. These files are generated
by the System Role component. This ensures the test
is as identical as possible to a real deployment,
with the exception that this test uses ipsec.conf
and ipsec.secrets that include from OUTPUT/hostname-ipsec.d/
where as in production this is done against /etc/ipsec.d

This example creates an west-east.conf file and a
west-east.secrets file for each.

In this case the connection is loaded with auto=ondemand
and the test sends a ping to trigger and test for the tunnel.

This test should work on namespaces as well as KVM/qemu.

NOTE: if renaming this test, also rename the include links
in the west/east configuration files.

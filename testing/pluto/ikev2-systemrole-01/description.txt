Scaffolding test case for testing VPN System Roles

Currently tailored for namespaces, will show different
output in KVM

The idea is that "nic" is the provisioning host that
runs the system role tools to push updated configs to
east and west over ssh.

In this case the connection is loaded with auto=ondemand
and the test sends a ping to trigger and test for the tunnel.

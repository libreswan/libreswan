IKEv2 labeled IPsec with an acquire happening part way through an IKE rekey

- the IKE rekey is initiated but <<--impair drop_outbound:1>>
  causes the request to be lost; the rekey becomes stuck
  until a retransmit (10s) gets things going again

- an acquire is triggered; initially it goes on to the old IKE SA
  queue but then the new IKE SA completes and it is moved to
  the new queue where it is initiated

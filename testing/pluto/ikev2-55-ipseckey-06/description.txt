The responder failto validate IPSECKEY of initiator and A record.

Road is the initiator and east is the responder.
Road has access to north's key, it has public and private key.

When road initiate the connection, it send an IKE request, and
simultaneously start query for the responders IPSECKEY in reverse zone.
23.2.1.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.    120 IN IPSECKEY 10 0 2 . AQO9bJbr3

When the east, the responder, receive IDi (in IKEv2 AUTH exchange),
IDi type FQDN, responder will query forward zone for IPSECKEY.

north.testing.libreswan.org. 120 IN IPSECKEY 10 0 2 . AQ

east also send adtional query for north.testing.libreswan.org.

A reocrd does not match the address(es) returned to the current address.

The authentication fail.

This only works without NAT.

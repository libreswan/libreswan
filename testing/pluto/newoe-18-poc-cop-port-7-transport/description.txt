An OE connection only covering tcp port 7 to east

(we use 7 so we can echo something and get closed connection)

Now using transport mode to test whether we still properly pick up the
port numbers, as with tunnel mode these reside in the "client"
(subnet) definition and for transport mode the "client" values are not
used.

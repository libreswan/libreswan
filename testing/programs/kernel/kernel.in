#
#
#	PLUTO_VERB
#		specifies the name of the operation to be performed
#		(prepare-host, prepare-client, up-host, up-client,
#		down-host, or down-client).  If the address family
#		for security gateway to security gateway communications
#		is IPv6, then a suffix of -v6 is added to the
#		verb.
#
#	PLUTO_CONNECTION
#		is the name of the  connection  for  which  we  are
#		routing.
#
#	PLUTO_CONNECTION_TYPE
#		is type of the connection, "tunnel" or "transport".
#
#	PLUTO_CONN_POLICY
#		the policy of the connection, as in:
#		RSASIG+ENCRYPT+TUNNEL+PFS+DONTREKEY+OPPORTUNISTIC+failureDROP+lKOD+rKOD
#
#	PLUTO_NEXT_HOP
#		is the next hop to which packets bound for the peer
#		must be sent.
#
#	PLUTO_INTERFACE
#		is the name of the ipsec interface to be used.
#
#	PLUTO_ME
#		is the IP address of our host.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT
#		is the IP address / count of our client subnet.  If
#		the  client  is  just  the  host,  this will be the
#		host's own IP address / mask (where max is  32  for
#		IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_NET
#		is the IP address of our client net.  If the client
#		is just the host, this will be the  host's  own  IP
#		address.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_CLIENT_MASK
#		is  the  mask for our client net.  If the client is
#		just the host, this will be 255.255.255.255.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP
#		if non-empty, then the source address for the route will be
#		set to this IP address.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_PROTOCOL
#		is the protocol  for this  connection.  Useful  for
#		firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_MY_PORT
#		is the port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER
#		is the IP address of our peer.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT
#		is the IP address / count of the peer's client subnet.
#		If the client is just the peer, this will be
#		the peer's own IP address / mask (where  max  is  32
#		for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6).
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_NET
#		is the IP address of the peer's client net.  If the
#		client is just the peer, this will  be  the  peer's
#		own IP address.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT_MASK
#		is  the  mask  for  the  peer's client net.  If the
#		client   is   just   the   peer,   this   will   be
#		255.255.255.255.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_PROTOCOL
#		is  the  protocol  set  for  remote  end  with port
#		selector.
#
#	PLUTO_PEER_PORT
#		is the peer's port. Useful for firewalling.
#
#	PLUTO_STACK
#		The kernel level IPstack used (see protostack=)
#
#	PLUTO_SA_REQID
#		When using KAME or XFRM/NETKEY, the IPsec SA reqid value

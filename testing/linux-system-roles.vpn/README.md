# VPN System Role

A Role for managing setup and configuration of VPN tunnels.

Basic usage:

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    bastion1.example.com: {...}
    bastion2.example.com: {...}
    bastion3.example.com: {...}
  vars:
    vpn_connections:
      - hosts:
          bastion1.example.com:
          bastion2.example.com:
          bastion3.example.com:
```

The role will set up a vpn tunnel between each pair of hosts in the list of `vpn_connections`, using the default parameters, including generating keys as needed.  This role assumes that the names of the hosts under `hosts` are the same as the names of the hosts used in the Ansible inventory, and that you can use those names to configure the tunnels (i.e. they are real FQDNs that resolve correctly).

## Requirements

The Ansible controller requires the python `netaddr` package.

## Variables

These global variables should be applied to the configuration for every tunnel (unless the user overrides them in the configuration of a particular tunnel).

|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|-------------------------|
| vpn\_provider                        | VPN provider to use (e.g. libreswan, wireguard, etc.)                                         | str         | no       | libreswan               |
| [vpn\_auth\_method](#vpn_auth_method)| VPN authentication method to use.                                                             | str         | no       | psk                     |

### vpn_auth_method

Acceptable values are `psk` for shared secrets (PSK) authentication or `cert` for authentication using certificates.

### vpn_connections

`vpn_connections` is a list of connections.  Each connection is either (1) a list of hosts specified by `hosts` or (2) a mesh configuration consisting of one or more subnets and profiles. In the first case (host-to-host use case), the role creates tunnels between each pair of hosts. At least one tunnel must be defined in this list. In the second case (mesh use case), the role deploys an opportunistic mesh configuration using the `policy`/`cidr` pairs defined by the user under `policies`.

The user may provide a number of other variables that should be applied to the configuration for each tunnel. The list of these connection-specific options is outlined in the table below.

| Parameter                                 | Description                                                                           | Type        | Required | Default                 | Libreswan Equivalent    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|-------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| [name](#name)                             | A unique, arbitrary name used to prefix the the connection name.                      | str         | no       | See [name](#name).      | conn `<name>`           |
| [hosts](#hosts)                           | A vpn tunnel will be constructed between each pair of hosts in this dictionary.       | dict        | yes      | -                       | -                       |
| [auth_method](#auth_method)               | Authentication method to be used for this connection.                                 | str         | no       | vpn\_auth\_method       | authby                  |
| [auto](#auto)                             | What operation, if any, should be done automatically at startup.                      | str         | no       | -                       | auto                    |
| [opportunistic](#opportunistic)           | If an opportunistic mesh configuration should be used.                                | bool        | no       | vpn\_opportunistic      | -                       |
| [policies](#policies)                     | List of policy settings to use for an opportunistic mesh configuration.               | list        | no       | -                   | -                       |

### name

By default, the role will generate a descriptive name for each tunnel it creates. For example, when creating a tunnel between `bastion1` and `bastion2`, the descriptive name of this connection on `bastion1` will be `bastion1-to-bastion2`. Similarly, the name of the connection associated with this tunnel on `bastion2` will be `bastion2-to-bastion1`. The user may choose to prefix these auto-generated names by specifying a value in the `name` field.

### auth_method

The user can define an authentication method to use at the connection level, however this is optional. If this parameter is not defined, the role will default to using the global variable `vpn_auth_method`. The value specified in this parameter will infer the value to be used in the `authby` field for a Libreswan tunnel. Acceptable values are the same as for `vpn_auth_method` (see [vpn_auth_method](#vpn_auth_method)). 

### auto

What operation, if any, should be done automatically at IPsec startup. Currently-accepted values are **add**, **ondemand**, **start**, and **ignore** (also the default, signifies no automatic startup operation).

### opportunistic

By default, when multiple nodes are specified within a `vpn_connection`, host-to-host tunnels are created between each pair of those nodes. To override this in favor of using an opportunistic mesh configuration, the user can set `opportunistic` to true. If this is set to `true`, it is assumed that all hosts in the ansible inventory are to be included in this opportunistic mesh configuration.

### policies

Policy rules related to opportunistic encryption can be set in this dictionary. If no policy rules are set, the default policy rule is `private-or-clear` (to override this default policy rule, see [cidr](#cidr)). Note that the default policy does not add a `0.0.0.0/0` entry into a policy file, but rather individual CIDRs are added to policy files based on the CIDRs of the target machines. It follows that the default policy rule will be applied to CIDRs of all the hosts over which this role is run, unless the CIDR of a particular target machine or group of target machines has a different policy rule specifically stated by the user in this section. If users wish to add a `0.0.0.0/0` entry to a particular policy file, they may add an item to this list where the `policy` value is the desired policy to be applied, and the `cidr` value is `0.0.0.0/0`.

**Note:** When configuring mesh opportunistic VPN using a controller machine that shares the same CIDR as one or more of mesh CIDRs used for encryption, the user should add a `clear` policy entry for the controller machine CIDR in order to prevent an SSH connection loss during the play. See [example](#opportunistic-mesh-vpn-configuration).

| Parameter                                 | Description                                                                           | Type        | Required |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|
| [policy](#policy)                         | A valid policy connection group.                                                      | str         | no       |
| [cidr](#cidr)                             | A valid CIDR to apply this policy rule to.                                            | str         | no       |

#### policy

Valid values are `private`, `private-or-clear`, and `clear`.

#### cidr

In addition to any valid CIDR, the user may specify `default` in this field to apply the corresponding policy to all hosts that do not fit into one of the other specified policy groups, thereby overriding the default `private-or-clear` policy rule.

### hosts
Each key in this dictionary is the unique name of a host. If a host is listed here and is not part of the inventory list of hosts, it will be assumed that this host is not managed by our own inventory. In this case, the `hostname` parameter is required because it is necessary for setting up the local ends of such a tunnel. 

If the host key in the hosts list of your inventory is not the FQDN you want to use, you must use the `hostname` field under each host in this `vpn_connections` hosts dictionary to specify the actual FQDN or IP address you want the vpn role to use to set up the tunnel. If you do not specify `hostname`, then the role will use `ansible_host` if defined, or the host key in your hosts list if neither `ansible_host` nor `hostname` is defined. 

For each host key in this dictionary, the following host-specific parameters can be specified.  

| Parameter                         | Description                                                                                   | Type        | Required | Default                 | Libreswan Equivalent         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|-------------------------|:----------------------------:|
| [hostname](#hostname)             | Host or IP to use for setting up a vpn connection.                                            | str         | no       | -                       | left/right                   |
| [cert_name](#cert_name)           | Certificate nickname of this host's certificate in the NSS database.                          | str         | no       | -                       | leftcert/rightcert           |
| subnets                           | A list of the subnets that should be available via the VPN connection.                        | list        | no       | -                       | leftsubnets/rightsubnets     |

#### hostname

Can hold an IP address or FQDN. Specified only when overriding hostnames used by Ansible for SSH. Note that if a domain name is specified, it must be fully-qualified to ensure that DNS resolution will work correctly on host machines. This parameter is required when the host is not part of the inventory list of hosts.

#### cert_name
It is assumed that the `cert_name` provided by the user exists in the IPSec NSS cert database. Users may use the certificate system role to issue these certificates.

## Verifying a successful startup

### Libreswan

To confirm that a connection is successfully loaded:
```
ipsec status | grep <connectionname>
```

To confirm that a connection is successfully started:
```
ipsec trafficstatus | grep <connectionname>
```

To verify that a certificate has been imported (requires that the connection has loaded successfully). Note that if the same certificate is used for multiple connections, it may show up in the output for this command, even though there was an error on the connection being checked:
```
ipsec whack --listcerts
```

If a connection did not successfully load, it is recommended to run the following command to manually try to add the connection. This will give more specific information indicating why the connection failed to establish:

```
ipsec auto --add <connectionname>
```

Any errors that may have occurred during the process of loading and starting the connection are in the logs, which can be found in `/var/log/pluto.log` in RHEL 8, or by issuing the command `journalctl -u ipsec` in RHEL 7. Since these logs can be verbose and contain old entries, it is generally recommended to try to manually add the connection to obtain log messages from the standard output instead.

## Firewall

The firewall must be configured to allow traffic on 500 and 4500/UDP ports for the IKE, ESP, and AH protocols. In the future, the firewall system role may be used for this configuration, however in the meantime these settings will need to be manually configured.

### RHEL 8 and 9

The following commands configure the firewall for RHEL 8 and 9 systems, and other systems which use `firewalld`:

```
firewall-cmd --add-service="ipsec"
firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent

```

## Use Cases

- Host-to-Host (openstack): Specific nodes connecting to each other. Use IPsec for IP failover between these nodes (so all other nodes don't need to be aware of anything happening). Keys are FreeIPA certificates, and pre-shared keys
- Host-to-Host (data centers): Two systems in different data centers communicate encrypted with each other using FreeIPA certificates, and pre-shared keys
- Host-to-Host (one host): One system communicating with an existing system (e.g., cisco) in an other organization that uses pre-shared keys
- Network-to-Network (two routers): One organization router connecting to a second one bringing together two distinct networks. Keys are FreeIPA certificates, and pre-shared keys.
- VPN Remote Access Server / Roadwarrior: One organization router accepting connections from multiple clients. Clients connect to a single router using FreeIPA certificates.
- MESH: node independent configurations. When adding/removing a node, you don't need to reconfigure all other nodes. They all attempt to setup individual host-to-host connections. A PKI is used to authenticate nodes (FreeIPA, potentially in the future DNSSEC)

Note that for a couple of these use cases, you cannot use host-scoped settings (e.g. global settings specified in `all.hosts`).

## Examples

### Host-to-host (multiple VPN tunnels with one externally managed host)

This playbook sets up the tunnel `bastion_east-to-bastion_west` using pre-shared key authentication with keys auto-generated by the system role. Additionally, the local ends of two more tunnels are set up: `bastion_east-to-bastion_north` and `bastion_west-to-bastion_north`. In this case, one of the hosts, `bastion_north`, is external to the inventory e.g. in a remote datacenter, and only the local ends of the tunnels can be set up. The `hostname` field contains all the information necessary to ensure that the local ends of the tunnel are set up correctly.

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    bastion_east:
      ansible_host: bastion1.example.com
    bastion_west:
      ansible_host: bastion2.example.com
  vars:
    vpn_connections:
      - hosts:
          bastion_east:
          bastion_west:
          bastion_north: # not in the hosts list
            hostname: 192.168.122.103
```

### Host-to-host (multiple VPN tunnels with multiple NICS)

In this case, the hosts have multiple vpn connections associated with multiple NICs e.g. some OpenStack and OpenShift use cases.

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    bastion_east: {...}
    bastion_west: {...}
    bastion_north: {...}
  vars:
    vpn_connections:
      - name: control_plane_vpn
        hosts:
          bastion_east:
            hostname: 192.168.122.101 # IP for control plane
          bastion_west:
            hostname: 192.168.122.102
          bastion_north:
            hostname: 192.168.122.103
      - name: data_plane_vpn
        hosts:
          bastion_east:
            hostname: 10.0.0.1 # IP for data plane
          bastion_west:
            hostname: 10.0.0.2
          bastion_north:
            hostname: 10.0.0.3
```

### Host-to-host (multiple VPN tunnels using certificates)

This playbook sets up host-to-host tunnels between each pair of hosts in the list of `hosts` using certificates for authentication.

```yaml
  hosts:
    bastion1.example.com: {...}
    bastion2.example.com: {...}
    bastion3.example.com: {...}
  vars:
    vpn_connections:
      - name: vpn-tunnel-x
        auth_method: cert
        auto: start
        hosts:
          bastion1.example.com:
            cert_name: bastion1cert
          bastion2.example.com:
            cert_name: bastion2cert
          bastion3.example.com:
            cert_name: bastion3cert
```

### Opportunistic Mesh VPN configuration

This playbook sets up an opportunistic mesh VPN configuration on each host in the list of `hosts`, using certificates for authentication. In this example, the controller machine shares the same CIDR as both of the target machines (`192.168.110.0/24`) and has IP address `192.168.110.7`. Therefore the controller machine will fall under a `private` policy which will automatically be created for the CIDR `192.168.110.0/24`. To prevent an SSH connection loss during the play, a `clear` policy for the controller machine has been added to the list of  `policies`. Note that there is also an item in the `policies` list where the `cidr` is equal to `default`. This is because this playbook is overriding the default policy rule to make it `private` instead of `private-or-clear`.

```yaml
  hosts:
    bastion1.example.com:
      cert_name: bastion1cert
    bastion2.example.com:
      cert_name: bastion2cert
    bastion3.example.com:
      cert_name: bastion3cert
  vars:
    vpn_connections:
      - opportunistic: true
        auth_method: cert
        policies:
          - policy: private
            cidr: default
          - policy: private-or-clear
            cidr: 192.168.122.0/24
          - policy: private
            cidr: 192.168.110.0/24
          - policy: clear
            cidr: 192.168.110.7/32         
```

## To be added in a future release

The following global variables will be added. Additionally, `pubkey` will be added as a valid option under `vpn_auth_method` to perform public key authentication without certificates (enforces SHA-2).

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                   | Type        | Required | Default                 |

### shared_key

`shared_key_src` indicates the path to a file on the controller host containing a PSK to be copied to the `ipsec.secrets` file on the managed node.

`shared_key_content` contains the actual PSK in a vault secret or base64 encoded string. This will also be copied to the `ipsec.secrets` file on the managed node.

**Notes: It is not recommended to populate either of these two fields, since the role will automatically generate a secure pre-shared key if none is provided by the user. If the user does wish to provide their own pre-shared key, the recommendation is to vault encrypt the value. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html. Also, since it is still unclear how the role will allow users to specific pre-shared keys for each pair of hosts in a tunnel, it is reiterated that users should rely on the role's ability to generate secure pre-shared keys automatically.**

### public_key

`public_key_src` specifies a path to a file on the controller host containing the public key used by this host for public key authentication without certificates. Otherwise, the user can directly specify the public key for this host by populating `public_key_content`. `public_key_content` can also accept a CKAID or nickname for a public key in the NSS database.

Note that `public_key_src` and `public_key_content` may also be specified as host-scoped Ansible variables. The variable names in this case will be `vpn_public_key_src` and `vpn_public_key_content`..

If neither `public_key_src` nor `public_key_content` is populated, the role will generate key pairs for each host.

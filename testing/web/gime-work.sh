Usage:

    $0 <summarydir> [ <repodir> [ <first-commit> ] ]

Select, and then print, an untested commit in the range
[<first-commit>..HEAD].

First choice is HEAD; second choice is something "interesting" such as
a tag or branch (see git-interesting.sh); and the third choice is to
split the longest run of untested commits.

If no untested commit is selected, the script exits non-zero.

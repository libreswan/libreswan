# Work around problem with broken shells (e.g. Busybox sh).
# We are called with stdout & stderr going to a logger process started
# by "ipsec setup". For some reason, when the below loop runs with
# stdout & stderr redirected to a new logger, the pipe to the old logger
# is leaked through to _plutorun as file descriptor 11, and the old
# logger (and "ipsec setup") can never exit. By closing fds 1 & 2
# before they can be dup'd to 11, we somehow avoid the problem.
# This problem may also apply to Ubuntu's dash shell
# but the workaround has not been tested there.

Note that eroute is only supported on the classic KLIPS stack\&. It is not supported on any other stack and will be completely removed in future versions\&. On the
\fBmast\fR
stack, use
\fIipsec policy\fR, on the
\fBnetkey\fR
stack, use
\fIip xfrm\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
/proc/net/ipsec_eroute
lists the IPSEC extended routing tables, which control what (if any) processing is applied to non\-encrypted packets arriving for IPSEC processing and forwarding\&. At this point it is a read\-only file\&.
.PP
A table entry consists of:
.PP
+
.RS 4
packet count,
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
source address with mask and source port (0 if all ports or not applicable)
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
a \*(Aq\->\*(Aq separator for visual and automated parsing between src and dst
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
destination address with mask and destination port (0 if all ports or not applicable)
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
a \*(Aq=>\*(Aq separator for visual and automated parsing between selection criteria and SAID to use
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
SAID (Security Association IDentifier), comprised of:
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
protocol (\fIproto\fR),
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
address family (\fIaf\fR), where \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq stands for IPv4 and \*(Aq:\*(Aq for IPv6
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
Security Parameters Index (\fISPI\fR),
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
effective destination (\fIedst\fR), where the packet should be forwarded after processing (normally the other security gateway) together indicate which Security Association should be used to process the packet,
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
a \*(Aq:\*(Aq separating the SAID from the transport protocol (0 if all protocols)
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
source identity text string with no whitespace, in parens,
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
destination identity text string with no whitespace, in parens
.RE
.PP
Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6 coloned hex, protocol is one of "ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun" and SPIs are prefixed hexadecimal numbers where the prefix \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq is for IPv4 and the prefix \*(Aq:\*(Aq is for IPv6
.PP
SAIDs are written as "protoafSPI@edst"\&. There are also 5 "magic" SAIDs which have special meaning:
.PP
+
.RS 4
\fB%drop\fR
means that matches are to be dropped
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
\fB%reject\fR
means that matches are to be dropped and an ICMP returned, if possible to inform
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
\fB%trap\fR
means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE message to the Key Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute will be put in place to prevent subsequent packets also triggering ACQUIRE messages\&.
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
\fB%hold\fR
means that matches are to stored until the eroute is replaced or until that eroute gets reaped
.RE
.PP
+
.RS 4
\fB%pass\fR
means that matches are to allowed to pass without IPSEC processing

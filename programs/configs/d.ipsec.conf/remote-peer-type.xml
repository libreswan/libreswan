<para>Set the remote peer type. This can enable additional processing
during the IKE negotiation.  Acceptable values are <emphasis
remap='B'>cisco</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>ietf</emphasis>
(the default).  When set to cisco, support for Cisco IPsec gateway
redirection and Cisco obtained DNS and domainname are enabled.  This
includes automatically updating (and restoring) /etc/resolv.conf. These
options require that  XAUTH is also enabled on this connection.  </para>

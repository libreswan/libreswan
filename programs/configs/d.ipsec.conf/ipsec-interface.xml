Create a new IPsec interface or use an existing interface (type xfrm) for
"Routing based VPNs" (as opposed to "Policy based VPNs").

The ipsec-interface, aka xfrmi, can be used to route egress traffic
for encryption, and decrypted traffic will ingress from this interface,
this connection. All traffic that is routed to this interface will be automatically
encrypted when there is a IPsec SA policy covering the
source/destination traffic. Tools such as tcpdump, iptables or tools that need traffic counters can be
used on all cleartext pre-encrypt and post-decrypt traffic on the device.
IPsec interfaces are currently only supported on Linux with XFRM/NETKEY. The
_updown script handles certain Linux specific interfaces settings
required for proper functioning (forwarding, routing rules for IPsec/ESP traffic).
When the leftsubet is equal to rightsubnet the routing should be manged by administrators.

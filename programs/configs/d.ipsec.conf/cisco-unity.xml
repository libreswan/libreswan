<para>whether to send a CISCO_UNITY payload to the peer.
Acceptable values are: <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.

It is recommended to leave this option unset, unless the remote peer
(Cisco client or server) requires it. This option does not modify local
behaviour. It can be needed to connect as a client to a Cisco server. It
can also be needed to act as a server for a Cisco client, which otherwise
might send back an error DEL_REASON_NON_UNITY_PEER.

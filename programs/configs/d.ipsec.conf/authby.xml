<para>how the two security gateways should authenticate each other;
acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>rsasig</emphasis> (the default)
for RSA digital signatures based authentication,
<emphasis remap='B'>secret</emphasis> for shared secrets (PSK) authentication,
<emphasis remap='B'>secret|rsasig</emphasis> for either,
<emphasis remap='B'>never</emphasis> if negotiation is never to be attempted
or accepted (useful for shunt-only conns), and
<emphasis remap='B'>null</emphasis> for null-authentication.

<para>
Digital signatures are superior in every way to shared secrets. Especially
IKEv1 in Aggressive Mode is vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks and
is performed routinely by at least the NSA on monitored internet traffic
globally. The never option is only used for connections that do not actually
start an IKE negotiation, such as type=passthrough connections. The auth
method null is used for "anonymous opportunistic IPsec" and should not be
used for regular pre-configured IPsec VPNs.

<para>IKEv2 (RFC 7296) settings to be used. Currently the accepted
values are <emphasis remap='B'>permit</emphasis>(the default),
signifying IKEv2 will be accepted if received, but IKEv1 will be used
when initiating; <emphasis remap='B'>never</emphasis> or <emphasis
remap='B'>no</emphasis> signifying no IKEv2 negotiation should be
transmitted or accepted; <emphasis remap='B'>propose</emphasis> or
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> signifying that we permit IKEv1
and IKEv2, and use IKEv2 as the default to initiate; and <emphasis
remap='B'>insist</emphasis>signifying we only accept and receive IKEv2 -
IKEv1 negotiations will be rejected.
</para><para>
If the ikev2= setting is set to <emphasis remap='B'>permit</emphasis>
or <emphasis remap='B'>propose</emphasis>, Libreswan will try and detect a
"bid down" attack from IKEv2 to IKEv1.  Since there is no standard for
transmitting the IKEv2 capability with IKEv1, Libreswan uses a special
Vendor ID "CAN-IKEv2". If a fall back from IKEv2 to IKEv1 was detected,
and the IKEv1 negotiation contains Vendor ID "CAN-IKEv2", Libreswan will
immediately attempt and IKEv2 rekey and refuse to use the IKEv1 connection.
With an ikev2= setting of <emphasis remap='B'>insist</emphasis>, no IKEv1
negotiation is allowed, and no bid down attack is possible.</para>

<para>Whether to allow MOBIKE (RFC 4555) to enable a connection to migrate
its endpoint without needing to restart the connection from scratch. This
is used on mobile devices that switch between wired, wireless or mobile
data connections. Current values are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default)
or <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, Only connection acting as modecfgclient
will allow the initiator to migrate using mobike. Only connections acting as
modecfgserver will allow clients to migrate.
</para>
<para>VTI and MOBIKE might not work well when used together.

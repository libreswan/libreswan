The value for the IPsec SA security context attribute identifier that is
used for Labeled IPsec.  Defaults to the private use IANA value 32001
from the IPsec SA attributes registry. Old openswan versions might
still be using the (stolen) value 10, which has since been assigned by
IANA for something else. Other values are not recommended unless IANA
assigns an actual value for this. See also labeled-ipsec= and policy-label=

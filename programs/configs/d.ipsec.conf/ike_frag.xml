<para>Whether or not to allow IKE fragmentation. Valid values are are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, (the default), <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
or <emphasis remap='B'>force</emphasis>. 
</para><para>
IKE fragmentation capablities are negotiated via <emphasis remap='I'>vendor id</emphasis>.
If pluto does not receive the FRAGMENTATION vendor id, no IKE fragments will be sent, regardless
of the ike_fraa=g setting. When set to <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, IKE fragmentation will be attempted
on the first re-transmit of an IKE packet of a size larger then 572 bytes for IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.
If ike_frag is set to force, IKE fragmentation is used on initial transmits of such sized packets as well.
When we have received IKE fragments for a connection, pluto behaves as if in force mode.

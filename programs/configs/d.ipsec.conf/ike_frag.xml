<para>Whether or not to allow IKE fragmentation. Valid values are are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, (the default), <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
or <emphasis remap='B'>force</emphasis>.

IKE fragmentation capabilities are negotiated via <emphasis remap='I'>vendor
id</emphasis>.
If pluto does not receive the FRAGMENTATION vendor id, no IKE fragments will
be sent, regardless of the ike_frag= setting. When set to
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, IKE fragmentation will be attempted
on the first re-transmit of an IKE packet of a size larger then 576 bytes for
IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.
If ike_frag is set to force, IKE fragmentation is used on initial transmits of
such sized packets as well.
When we have received IKE fragments for a connection, pluto behaves as if in
force mode.

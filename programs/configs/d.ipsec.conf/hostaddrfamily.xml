<para>the address family of the hosts; currently the accepted
values are <emphasis remap='B'>ipv4</emphasis> and
<emphasis remap='B'>ipv6</emphasis>. The default is to detect this based on the
IP addresses specified or the IP addresses resolved, so this option is not needed,
unless you specify hostnames that resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6. This option used
to be named connaddrfamily but its use was broken so it was obsoleted in favour
or using the new hostaddrfamily and clientaddrfamily.

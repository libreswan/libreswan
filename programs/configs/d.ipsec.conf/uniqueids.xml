  <listitem>
<para> Whether IDs should be considered identifying remote parties
uniquely. Acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> (the
default) and <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>.  Participant IDs normally
are unique, so a new connection instance using the same remote ID is
almost invariably intended to replace an old existing connection.
</para>
<para> When the connection is defined to be a server (using xauthserver=)
and the connection policy is authby=secret, this option is ignored (as
of 3.20) and old connections will never be replaced.  This situation is
commonly known as clients using a "Group ID".
</para>
<para> This option may disappear in the near future. People using identical
X.509 certificates on multiple devices are urged to upgrade to use separate
certificates per client and device.

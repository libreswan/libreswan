When configured as IKEv1 ModeCFG or IKEv2 server, specifying any of these options will
cause those options and values to be sent to the connecting client. Libreswan as a client
will use these received options to either update /etc/resolv.conf or the running unbound DNS
server. When the connection is brought down, the previous DNS resolving state is restored.
</para>
<para>
The modecfgdns option takes a comma or space separated list of IP addresses that can be used
for DNS resolution. The modecfgdomains option takes a comma or space separated list of internal
domain names that are reachable via the supplied modecfgdns DNS servers.
</para>
<para>The IKEv1 split tunnel directive will be sent automatically if the xauth server side has
configured a network other than 0.0.0.0/0. For IKEv2, this is automated via narrowing.

<para>
a unique identifier used to match IPsec SAs using iptables with
NETKEY/XFRM. This identifier is normally automatically allocated in groups
of 4. It is exported to the _updown script as REQID. On Linux, reqids are
supported with IP Connection Tracking and NAT (iptables). Automatically
generated values use the range 16380 and higher. Manually specified
reqid values therefor must be between 1 and 16379.
</para>
<para>
Automatically generated reqids use a range of 0-3 (eg 16380-16383 for the
first reqid). These are used depending on the exact policy (AH, AH+ESP,
IPCOMP, etc). Manually assigned reqids are all identical. Instantiations
of connections (those using %any wildcards) will all use the same reqid.

For KLIPS, when using the MAST variant, a different mechanism called
SAref is in use. See overlapip and sareftrack.

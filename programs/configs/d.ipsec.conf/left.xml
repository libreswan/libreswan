<para>(required)
the IP address of the left participant's public-network interface,
Currently, IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported.
There are several magic values.  If it is
<emphasis remap='B'>%defaultroute</emphasis>,
and
the
<emphasis remap='B'>config setup</emphasis>
section's,
<emphasis remap='B'>interfaces</emphasis>
specification contains
<emphasis remap='B'>%defaultroute</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>
will be filled in automatically with the local address
of the default-route interface (as determined at IPsec startup time);
this also overrides any value supplied for
<emphasis remap='B'>leftnexthop</emphasis>.
(Either
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>
or
<emphasis remap='B'>right</emphasis>
may be
<emphasis remap='B'>%defaultroute</emphasis>,
but not both.)
The value
<emphasis remap='B'>%any</emphasis>
signifies an address to be filled in (by automatic keying) during
negotiation.
The value
<emphasis remap='B'>%opportunistic</emphasis>
signifies that both
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>leftnexthop</emphasis>
are to be filled in (by automatic keying) from DNS data for
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>'s
client.
The value can also contain the interface name, which will then later be
used to obtain the IP address from to fill in. For example
<emphasis remap='B'>%ppp0</emphasis>

The values
<emphasis remap='B'>%group</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>%opportunisticgroup</emphasis>
makes this a policy group conn: one that will be instantiated
into a regular or opportunistic conn for each CIDR block listed in the
policy group file with the same name as the conn.</para>
<para>If using IP addresses in combination with NAT, always use the
actual local machine's (NATed) IP address, and if the remote (eg right=)
is NATed as well, the remote's public (<emphasis remap='B'>not</emphasis>
NATed) IP address. Note that this makes the configuration no longer
symmetrical on both sides, so you cannot use an identical configuration
file on both hosts.</para>

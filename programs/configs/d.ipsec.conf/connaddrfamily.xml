<para>the connection address family of the connection; currently the accepted
values are <emphasis remap='B'>ipv4</emphasis> (the default); or
<emphasis remap='B'>ipv6</emphasis>. This option is confusing, especially when
doing IPv4-in-IPv6 or IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels. The developers hope to remove this
option in the near future for proper auto-detection. For now, set connaddrfamily=
to the family of the *subnet= options, and if those are not defined, to the family
of the left=/right= options.

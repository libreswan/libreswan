the left participant
should be identified for authentication;
defaults to
<emphasis remap='B'>left</emphasis>.
Can be an IP address or a fully-qualified domain name which will be resolved.
If preceded by <emphasis remap='B'>@</emphasis>, the value is used as
a literal string and will not be resolved.

To support opaque identifiers (usually of type ID_KEY_ID, such as used by
Cisco to specify Group Name, use square brackets, eg <emphasis remap='B'>rightid=@[GroupName]</emphasis>.

The magic value
<emphasis remap='B'>%fromcert</emphasis>
causes the ID to be set to a DN taken from a certificate that is loaded.
Prior to 2.5.16, this was the default if a certificate was specified.

The magic value
<emphasis remap='B'>%none</emphasis>
sets the ID to no ID. This is included for completeness, as the ID may
have been set in the default conn, and one wishes for it to default instead
of being explicitly set.

The magic value
<emphasis remap='B'>%myid</emphasis>
stands for the current setting of <emphasis remap='I'>myid</emphasis>.

This is set in <emphasis remap='B'>config setup</emphasis> or by <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_whack</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>), or, if not set,
it is the IP address in <emphasis remap='B'>%defaultroute</emphasis> (if that is supported by a TXT record in its reverse domain), or otherwise
it is the system's hostname (if that is supported by a TXT record in its forward domain), or otherwise it is undefined.</para>
<para>
When using certificate based ID's, one need to specify the full RDN, optionally using wildcard matching (eg CN='*'). If
the RDN contains a comma, this can be masked using a comma (eg OU='Foo,, Bar and associates')</para>

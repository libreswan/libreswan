<para>whether to send a CISCO_UNITY payload to the peer we are initiating to.
Acceptable values are: <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.

It is recommended to leave this option unset, unless the remote peer
(Cisco) requires it. This is an experimental option. It does not modify local
behaviour. It is expected the remote peer might behave differently when it
receives this vendor id. This option might be removed in a future release.

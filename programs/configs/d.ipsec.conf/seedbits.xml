Pluto uses the NSS crypto library as its random source. Some government
Three Letter Agencies require that pluto reads additional bits from /dev/random
and feed these into the NSS RNG before drawing random from the NSS library,
despite the NSS library itself already seeding its internal state. This
process can block pluto for an extended time during startup, depending on
the entropy of the system. Therefore, the default is to not perform this
redundant seeding. If specifying a value, it is recommended to specify at
least 460 bits (for FIPS) or 440 bits (for BSI).

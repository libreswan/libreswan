<para>whether to send an INITIAL_CONTACT payload to the peer we are initiating to, if we currently have no
IPsec SAs up with that peer.  Acceptable values are: <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.

It is recommended to leave this option unset, unless the remote peer
requires it to allow reconnects. The only known peer at this time
is Cisco, which will not allow a reconnect (despite authentication)
to replace an existing IPsec SA unless it receives an INITIAL_CONTACT
payload. Receiving this payload is ignored and the choice to replace
or add an IPsec SA when libreswan is a responder is purely based on
the <emphasis remap='B'>uniqueids</emphasis> setting, which should be
left enabled unless libreswan acts as an XAUTH server using PSK ("group
secret").  This option can cause a few seconds of downtime on the IPsec
tunnel between the time the remote clears the old IPsec SA in response
to our INITIAL_CONTACT message, and the time we finish setting up the
new IPsec SA. If there is an XAUTH step in between, and especially when
XAUTH requires the use of some two-factor token, this downtime could be
even longer.

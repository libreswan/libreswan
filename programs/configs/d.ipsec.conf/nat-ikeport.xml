<para>The IKE NAT Traversal floating port (see RFC-3947) to listen on. The default
value is <emphasis remap='B'>4500</emphasis>.
As IKE/NATT is an internet standard, changing this means pluto will no longer be able to
interoperate with other devices, unless they have also been explicitly configured to use a
non-standard IKE/NATT port. There might also be other subtle assumptions within the kernel
that port 4500 is used. Changing this port is strongly discouraged, and should probably
only be done for testing or when required to circumvent VPN blocking technologies as
employed by certain commercial companies and national governments. See also

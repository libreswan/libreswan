<para>Set the length of time (in time units, defaults to seconds) that we
will idle without hearing back from our peer. After this period has elapsed
with no response and no traffic, we will declare the peer dead, and remove
the SA (default <literal>0</literal> seconds). Set value bigger than dpddelay
to enable. If dpdtimeout is set, dpddelay also needs to be set.</para>

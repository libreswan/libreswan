<para>IKEv1 supports PAM authorization via XAUTH using
<emphasis remap='I'>xauthby=pam</emphasis>. IKEv2 does not support receiveing
a plaintext username and password. Libreswan does not yet support EAP
authentication methods for IKE. The pam-authorize=yes option performs
an authorization call via PAM, but only includes the remote ID (not
username or password). This allows for backends to disallow an ID based
on non-password situations, such as "user disabled" or "user over quota".

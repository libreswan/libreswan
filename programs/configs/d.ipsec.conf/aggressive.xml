<para>Use IKEv1 Aggressive Mode instead of IKEv1 Main Mode. This option has no effect
when IKEv2 is used.  Acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default)
or <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>. When this option is enabled, IKEv1 Main Mode will
no longer be allowed for this connection. The old name of this option was
<emphasis remap='B'>aggrmode</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Aggressive Mode is less secure, and more vulnerable to Denial Of Service
attacks. It is also vulnerable to brute force attacks with software such
as <emphasis remap='B'>ikecrack</emphasis>. It should not be used, and
it should especially not be used with XAUTH and group secrets (PSK).
If the remote system administrator insists on staying irresponsible,
enable this option.</para>

<para>Aggressive Mode is further limited to only proposals with one
DH group as there is no room to negotiate the DH group. Therefor
it is mandatory for Aggressive Mode connections that both
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='B'>phase2alg=</emphasis>
options are specified with only one fully specified proposal using one
DH group. </para>
<para>
The KE payload is created in the first exchange packet when using
aggressive mode. The KE payload depends on the DH group used.  This is
why there cannot be multiple DH groups in IKEv1 aggressive mode.
In IKEv2, which uses a similar method to IKEv1 Aggressive Mode, there
is an INVALID_KE response payload that can inform the initiator of the
responder's desired DH group and so an IKEv2 connection can actually
recover from picking the wrong DH group by restarting its negotiation.

<para>Emulate a <emphasis remap='I'>busy system</emphasis> and take
counter measures. The value can be  <emphasis remap='I'>no</emphasis>
(the default) or  <emphasis remap='I'>yes</emphasis>. If enabled,
pluto will be forced to be "busy". In this state, which happens when
there is a Denial of Service attack,  pluto will use cookies
before accepting new incoming IKE packets. Cookies are send and required
for IKEv1 Aggressive Mode and in IKEv2.  This option is mostly used for
testing purposes, but can be selected by paranoid administrators as
well.</para>

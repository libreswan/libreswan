# This file defines the set of network destinations for which

# to use, will be encrypted on their request. This behaviour is also called
# "Opportunistic Responder".
#
# One IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR per line, optionally specifying a further
# narrowing of protocol, source port and destination port
#
# examples:
# encrypt all traffic to an IPv4 or IPv6 host or subnet if they request it
# 10.0.1.0/24
# 10.1.1.1/32
# 2a03:6000:1004:1::/64
#
# encrypt all smtp traffic to some host if they want to
#  10.0.1.0/24  tcp  0  25
# encrypt all incoming smtp traffic from some host if they request it
#  0.0.0.0/0  tcp  25  0

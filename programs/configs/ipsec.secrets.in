# This file holds shared secrets (PSK) and XAUTH user passwords used for
# authentication.  See pluto(8) manpage or the libreswan website.

# Unlike older openswan, this file does NOT contain any X.509 related
# information such as private key :RSA statements as these now reside
# in the NSS database. See:

#
# The preferred method for adding secrets is to create a new file in
# the @IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/ directory, so it will be included via the include
# line below

include @IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/*.secrets

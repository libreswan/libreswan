	# Normally, pluto logs via syslog. If you want to log to a file,
	# specify below or to disable logging, eg for embedded systems, use
	# the file name /dev/null
	# Note: SElinux policies might prevent pluto writing to a log file at
	#       an unusual location.
	#logfile=/var/log/pluto.log

	# Do not enable debug options to debug configuration issues!
	#
	# plutodebug "all", "none" or a combation from below:
	# "raw crypt parsing emitting control controlmore kernel pfkey
	#  natt x509 dpd dns oppo oppoinfo private".
	# Note: "private" is not included with "all", as it can show confidential
	#       information. It must be specifically specified
	# examples:
	# plutodebug="control parsing"
	# plutodebug="all crypt"
	# Again: only enable plutodebug when asked by a developer
	#plutodebug=none
	#
	# Enable core dumps (might require system changes, like ulimit -C)
	# This is required for abrtd to work properly
	# Note: SElinux policies might prevent pluto writing the core at

	# It seems that T-Mobile in the US and Rogers/Fido in Canada are

	# This range has never been announced via BGP (at least upto 2015)

# It is best to add your IPsec connections as separate files in @IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/

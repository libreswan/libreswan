# This file defines the set of network destinations for which
# communication should always be in the clear.
#
# One IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR per line, optionally specifying a further
# narrowing of protocol, source port and destination port
#
# examples:
# 10.0.1.0/24
# 2a03:6000:1004:1::/64
#
# don't IPsec encrypt ssh to a range
#  10.0.1.0/24  tcp  0  22
# don't IPsec encrypt any incoming ssh
#  0.0.0.0/0  tcp  22  0

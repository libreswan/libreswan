 * MAXIMUM_RETRANSMISSIONS times.  Each time we double
 * our patience.
 *
 * As a special case, if this is the first initiating message
 * of a Main Mode exchange, and we have been directed to try
 * forever, we'll extend the number of retransmissions to
 * MAXIMUM_RETRANSMISSIONS_INITIAL times, with all these
 * extended attempts having the same patience.  The intention
 * is to reduce the bother when nobody is home.
 *
 * Since IKEv1 is not reliable for the Quick Mode responder,
 * we'll extend the number of retransmissions as well to
 * improve the reliability.

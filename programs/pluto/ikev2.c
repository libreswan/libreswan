 * IKEv2 has slightly different states than IKEv1.
 *
 * IKEv2 puts all the responsibility for retransmission on the end that
 * wants to do something, usually, that the initiator. (But, not always
 * the original initiator, of the responder decides it needs to rekey first)
 *
 * Each exchange has a bit that indicates if it is an Initiator message,
 * or if it is a response.  The Responder never retransmits its messages
 * except in response to an Initiator retransmission.
 *
 * The message ID is *NOT* used in the cryptographic state at all, but instead
 * serves the role of a sequence number.  This makes the state machine far
 * simpler, and there really are no exceptions.
 *
 * The upper level state machine is therefore much simpler.
 * The lower level takes care of retransmissions, and the upper layer state
 * machine just has to worry about whether it needs to go into cookie mode,
 * etc.
 *
 * Like IKEv1, IKEv2 can have multiple child SAs.  Like IKEv1, each one of
 * the child SAs ("Phase 2") will get their own state. Unlike IKEv1,
 * an implementation may negotiate multiple CHILD_SAs at the same time
 * using different MessageIDs.  This is enabled by an option (a notify)
 * that the responder sends to the initiator.  The initiator may only
 * do concurrent negotiations if it sees the notify.
 *
 * XXX This implementation does not support concurrency, but it shouldn't be
 *     that hard to do.  The most difficult part will be to map the message IDs
 *     to the right state. Some CHILD_SAs may take multiple round trips,
 *     and each one will have to be mapped to the same state.
 *
 * The IKEv2 state values are chosen from the same state space as IKEv1.

	 * 2.23.  NAT Traversal
	 *
	 * [...]
	 *
	 * o There are cases where a NAT box decides to remove
	 *   mappings that are still alive (for example, the keepalive
	 *   interval is too long, or the NAT box is rebooted).  This
	 *   will be apparent to a host if it receives a packet whose
	 *   integrity protection validates, but has a different port,
	 *   address, or both from the one that was associated with
	 *   the SA in the validated packet.  When such a validated
	 *   packet is found, a host that does not support other
	 *   methods of recovery such as IKEv2 Mobility and
	 *   Multihoming (MOBIKE) [MOBIKE], and that is not behind a
	 *   NAT, SHOULD send all packets (including retransmission
	 *   packets) to the IP address and port in the validated
	 *   packet, and SHOULD store this as the new address and port
	 *   combination for the SA (that is, they SHOULD dynamically
	 *   update the address).  A host behind a NAT SHOULD NOT do
	 *   this type of dynamic address update if a validated packet
	 *   has different port and/or address values because it opens
	 *   a possible DoS attack (such as allowing an attacker to
	 *   break the connection with a single packet).  Also,
	 *   dynamic address update should only be done in response to
	 *   a new packet; otherwise, an attacker can revert the
	 *   addresses with old replayed packets.  Because of this,
	 *   dynamic updates can only be done safely if replay
	 *   protection is enabled.  When IKEv2 is used with MOBIKE,
	 *   dynamically updating the addresses described above
	 *   interferes with MOBIKE's way of recovering from the same
	 *   situation.  See Section 3.8 of [MOBIKE] for more
	 *   information.

 * XXX: A broken exception is when responding to an IKE_SA_INIT

 * with no state (trusting that the transition function will do the
 * job, but that isn't always true).  The fix is to create the state
 * before calling the state transition function (like is done for the
 * CHILD_SA code).
 *
 * Since, when initiating an exchange there is no message, code can't
 * assume that (*MDP) is non-NULL.
 *
 * XXX: Some state transition functions switch state part way (see
 * AUTH child code) and then tunnel the new state to this code via
 * (*MDP)->st and some callers passing in (*MDP)->st).  The fix is for
 * the AUTH code to handle the CHILD SA as a nested or separate
 * transition.
 *
 * XXX: The state transition structure (microcode) is stored in (*MDP)
 * forcing that structure to be created.  The fix is to store the
 * state's transition in the state.  As a bonus this makes determining
 * if a state is busy really really easy - if there's a
 * state-transition then it must be.
 *
 * This routine does not free (*MDP) (using md_delref(mdp)).
 * However, when suspending a state transition, it will save it in ST
 * and zap (*MDP) so that the caller can't free it.  Hence, the caller
 * must be prepared for (*MDP) being set to NULL.
 *

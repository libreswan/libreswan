	 *
	 * 2.  IKE Protocol Details and Variations
	 *
	 *     The UDP payload of all packets containing IKE messages
	 *     sent on port 4500 MUST begin with the prefix of four
	 *     zeros; otherwise, the receiver won't know how to handle
	 *     them.
	 *
	 * 2.23.  NAT Traversal
	 *
	 *     ... UDP encapsulation MUST NOT be done on port 500.
	 *
	 * 3.1.  The IKE Header
	 *
	 *     When sent on UDP port 500, IKE messages begin
	 *     immediately following the UDP header.  When sent on UDP
	 *     port 4500, IKE messages have prepended four octets of
	 *     zeros.
	 *
	 * I'm assuming that "sent on port ..." is intended to mean
	 * "sent from port ... to port ...".  But now we've got us
	 * deliberately sending from a random port to ...
	 *
	 * to port 500 with no ESP=0:
	 * -> since esp encal is disabled, the kernel passes the packet through
	 * -> pluto responds with no ESP=0
	 *
	 * to port 500 with ESP=0:
	 * -> since esp encal is disabled, the kernel passes the packet through
	 * -> pluto sees the ESP=0 prefix and rejects it
	 *
	 * to port 4500 with no ESP=0:
	 * -> since esp encap is enabled, the kernel will see the leading bytes
	 * are non-zero and eats an ESP packet
	 *
	 * to port 4500 with ESP=0:
	 * -> since esp encap is enabled, and ESP=0, kernel passes the packet through
	 * -> pluto sees ESP=0 prefix
	 * -> pluto responds with ESP=0 prefix
	 *
	 * to a random port:
	 * - to be able to work with NAT esp encap needs to be enabled and that
	 * in turn means all incoming messages must have the ESP=0 prefix
	 * - trying to negotiate to port 500 will fail - the incoming message
	 * will be missing the ESP=0 prefix
	 */

	 * doesn't make sense for TCP, and this doesn't make sense

/* State transition function infrastructure
 *
 * com_handle parses a message, decides what state object it applies to,
 * and calls the appropriate state transition function (STF).
 * These declarations define the interface to these functions.
 *
 * Each STF must be able to be restarted up to any failure point:
 * since an error will not advance the state,
 * a later message will cause the STF to be re-entered.  This
 * explains the use of the replace macro and the care in handling
 * MP_INT members of struct state.
 *
 * A state object (struct state) records what is known about
 * a state between transitions.  Between transitions is roughly:
 * at rest, waiting for an external event.
 *
 * A message digest (struct msg_digest) holds the dissected
 * packet (and more) during a state transition.  This gets
 * a bit muddied by the way packet fragments are re-assembled
 * and the way asyncronous processing cause state transitions
 * to be suspended (eg. crypto helper work).  Think of those
 * things as being within a single state transition.

/* There are two kinds of connections:
 * - ISAKMP connections, between hosts (for IKE communication)
 * - IPsec connections, between clients (for secure IP communication)
 *
 * An ISAKMP connection looks like:
 *   host<--->host
 *
 * An IPsec connection looks like:
 *   client-subnet<-->host<->nexthop<--->nexthop<->host<-->client-subnet
 *
 * For the connection to be relevant to this instance of Pluto,
 * exactly one of the hosts must be a public interface of our machine
 * known to this instance.
 *
 * The client subnet might simply be the host -- this is a
 * representation of "host mode".
 *
 * Each nexthop defaults to the neighbouring host's IP address.
 * The nexthop is a property of the pair of hosts, not each
 * individually.  It is only needed for IPsec because of the
 * way IPsec is mixed into the kernel routing logic.  Furthermore,
 * only this end's nexthop is actually used.  Eventually, nexthop
 * will be unnecessary.
 *
 * Other information represented:
 * - each connection has a name: a chunk of uninterpreted text
 *   that is unique for each connection.
 * - security requirements (currently just the "policy" flags from
 *   the whack command to initiate the connection, but eventually
 *   much more.  Different for ISAKMP and IPsec connections.
 * - rekeying parameters:
 *   + time an SA may live
 *   + time before SA death that a rekeying should be attempted
 *     (only by the initiator)
 *   + number of times to attempt rekeying
 * - With the current KLIPS, we must route packets for a client
 *   subnet through the ipsec interface (ipsec0).  Only one
 *   gateway can get traffic for a specific (client) subnet.
 *   Furthermore, if the routing isn't in place, packets will
 *   be sent in the clear.
 *   "routing" indicates whether the routing has been done for
 *   this connection.  Note that several connections may claim
 *   the same routing, as long as they agree about where the
 *   packets are to be sent.
 * - With the current KLIPS, only one outbound IPsec SA bundle can be
 *   used for a particular client.  This is due to a limitation
 *   of using only routing for selection.  So only one IPsec state (SA)
 *   may "own" the eroute.  "eroute_owner" is the serial number of
 *   this state, SOS_NOBODY if there is none.  "routing" indicates
 *   what kind of erouting has been done for this connection, if any.
 *
 * Details on routing is in constants.h
 *
 * Operations on Connections:
 *
 * - add a new connection (with all details) [whack command]
 * - delete a connection (by name) [whack command]
 * - initiate a connection (by name) [whack command]
 * - find a connection (by IP addresses of hosts)
 *   [response to peer request; finding ISAKMP connection for IPsec connection]
 *
 * Some connections are templates, missing the address of the peer
 * (represented by INADDR_ANY).  These are always arranged so that the
 * missing end is "that" (there can only be one missing end).  These can
 * be instantiated (turned into real connections) by Pluto in one of two
 * different ways: Road Warrior Instantiation or Opportunistic
 * Instantiation.  A template connection is marked for Opportunistic
 * Instantiation by specifying the peer client as 0.0.0.0/32 (or the IPV6
 * equivalent).  Otherwise, it is suitable for Road Warrior Instantiation.
 *
 * Instantiation creates a new temporary connection, with the missing
 * details filled in.  The resulting template lasts only as long as there
 * is a state that uses it.
 */

/*
 * Connection priority: how important this connection is
 *
 * - a whole number
 * - larger is more important
 * - three subcomponents.  In order of decreasing significance:
 *   + length of source subnet mask (9 bits)
 *   + length of destination subnet mask (9 bits)
 *   + bias (8 bit)
 * - a bias of 1 is added to allow prio BOTTOM_PRIO to be less than all
 *   normal priorities
 * - other bias values are created on the fly to give mild preference
 *   to certain conditions (eg. routedness)
 * - priority is inherited -- an instance of a policy has the same priority
 *   as the original policy, even though its subnets might be smaller.
 * - display format: n,m
 *
 * ??? These are NOT the same as sa_priorities but eventually they
 * should be aligned.

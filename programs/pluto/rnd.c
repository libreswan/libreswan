/* A true random number generator (we hope)
 *
 * Under LINUX, use NSS for FIPS compliant RNG.
 * Under OpenBSD ("__OpenBSD__" predefined), use arc4random().
 * Otherwise use our own random number generator based on clock skew.
 *   I (ADK) first heard of the idea from John Ioannidis, who heard it
 *   from Matt Blaze and/or Jack Lacy.
 * ??? Why is mixing need for linux but not OpenBSD?

/* Pluto's uses of randomness:
 *
 * - Setting up the "secret_of_the_day".  This changes every hour!  20
 *   bytes a shot.  It is used in building responder cookies.
 *
 * - generating initiator cookies (8 bytes, once per Phase 1 initiation).
 *
 * - IKEv1: 32 bytes per DH local secret.  Once per Aggr/Main Mode exchange and once
 *   per Quick Mode Exchange with PFS.  (Size is our choice, with
 *   tradeoffs.)
 * - IKEv2:
 *
 * - IKEv1: 16 bytes per nonce we generate.  Once per Aggr/Main Mode exchange and
 *   once per Quick Mode exchange.  (Again, we choose the size.)
 * - IKEv2:
 *
 * - 4 bytes per SPI number that we generate.  We choose the SPIs for all
 *   inbound SPIs, one to three per IPSEC SA (one for AH (rare, probably)
 *   one for ESP (almost always), and one for tunnel (very common)).
 *   I don't actually know how the kernel would generate these numbers --
 *   currently Pluto generates them; this isn't the way things will be
 *   done in the future.
 *
 * - 4 bytes per Message ID we need to generate.  One per Quick Mode
 *   exchange.  Eventually, one per informational exchange.

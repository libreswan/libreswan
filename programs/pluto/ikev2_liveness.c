 * The RFC (2.4.  State Synchronization and Connection Timeouts) as
 * this to say:
 *
 *   To be a good network citizen, retransmission times MUST increase
 *   exponentially to avoid flooding the network and making an
 *   existing congestion situation worse.  If there has only been
 *   outgoing traffic on all of the SAs associated with an IKE SA, it
 *   is essential to confirm liveness of the other endpoint to avoid
 *   black holes.  If no cryptographically protected messages have
 *   been received on an IKE SA or any of its Child SAs recently, the
 *   system needs to perform a liveness check in order to prevent
 *   sending messages to a dead peer.  (This is sometimes called "dead
 *   peer detection" or "DPD", although it is really detecting live
 *   peers, not dead ones.)  Receipt of a fresh cryptographically
 *   protected message on an IKE SA or any of its Child SAs ensures
 *   liveness of the IKE SA and all of its Child SAs.
 *
 * However:
 *
 * Only checking incoming packets does not demonstrate liveness.  Just
 * that half the channel is working.  All the incoming packets could
 * be retransmits.
 *
 * note: this mutates *st by calling get_ipsec_traffic

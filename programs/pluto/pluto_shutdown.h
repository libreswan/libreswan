 * main and some inner loops).  Just note that, on its own, it isn't

 *
 * Using the event-loop: shutdown the helper threads; clean up any
 * child processes; delete any states / connections; and close any
 * open sockets.
 *
 * Then, once the event-loop exits (which should happen once there's
 * nothing to do), clean up any remaining memory and exit pluto.
 *
 * The important thing here is that for much of the shutdown the event
 * loop is still running.  This way helper threads and states can
 * continue to rely on the event-loop as they transition to the
 * shutdown state (rather than special abort paths).

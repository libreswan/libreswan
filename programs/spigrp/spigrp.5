Note that spigrp is only supported on the classic KLIPS stack\&. It is not supported on any other stack and will be completely removed in future versions\&. A replacement command still needs to be designed
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
/proc/net/ipsec_spigrp
is a read\-only file that lists groups of IPSEC Security Associations (SAs)\&.
.PP
An entry in the IPSEC extended routing table can only point (via an SAID) to one SA\&. If more than one transform must be applied to a given type of packet, this can be accomplished by setting up several SAs with the same destination address but potentially different SPIs and protocols, and grouping them with
\fIipsec_spigrp(8)\fR\&.
.PP
The SA groups are listed, one line per connection/group, as a sequence of SAs to be applied (or that should have been applied, in the case of an incoming packet) from inside to outside the packet\&. An SA is identified by its SAID, which consists of protocol ("ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun"), SPI (with \*(Aq\&.\*(Aq for IPv4 or \*(Aq:\*(Aq for IPv6 prefixed hexadecimal number ) and destination address (IPv4 dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex) prefixed by \*(Aq@\*(Aq, in the format <proto><af><spi>@<dest>\&.

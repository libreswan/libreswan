/*
 * The jam buffer:
 *
 * ARRAY, a previously allocated array, containing the accumulated
 * NUL-terminated + CANARY-terminated output.
 *
 * ROOF:
 *
 * The offset of the the last character in the array.  It contains a
 * canary intended to catch overflows.  When sizeof(ARRAY) is needed,
 * ROOF should be used as otherwise the canary may be corrupted.
 *
 *   ROOF < sizeof(ARRAY)
 *   ARRAY[ROOF-0] = CANARY
 *   ARRAY[ROOF-1] == '\0'
 *
 * TOTAL:
 *
 * The number of characters that should have been written to the
 * ARRAY.
 *
 * When TOTAL<ROOF it is also strlen(ARRAY) and the index of the next
 * location vis:
 *
 *   TOTAL < ROOF => ARRAY[TOTAL] == '\0'
 *
 * When TOTAL>=ROOF, overflow has occured and no further characters are
 * written.
 *
 * When TOTAL==ROOF-1 the buffer is full.  Technically there is still
 * space for a string of length 0.  However any larger string will
 * trigger the overflow code and the last few characters will be
 * overwritten with DOTS.

 * BUF (a C variable name) is declared locally as a pointer to a
 * per-thread 'struct jambuf' buffer.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * This implementation stores the output in an array on the thread's
 * stack.  It could just as easily use the heap (but that would
 * involve memory overheads) or even a per-thread static variable.
 * Since the BUF variable is a pointer the specifics of the
 * implementation are hidden.
 *
 * This implementation, unlike DBG(), does not have a code block
 * parameter.  Instead it uses a sequence of for-loops to set things
 * up for a code block.  This avoids problems with "," within macro
 * parameters confusing the parser.  It also permits a simple
 * consistent indentation style.
 *
 * The stack array is left largely uninitialized (just a few strategic
 * entries are set).  This avoids the need to zero LOG_WITH bytes.
 *
 * Apparently chaining void function calls using a comma is valid C?

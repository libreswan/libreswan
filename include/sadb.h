 * This header pulls in all the SADB_* and sadb_* declarations
 * described by RFC 2368 (along with any extensions which use the
 * prefix SADB_X_... or sadb_x_...).
 *
 * Typically this just involves including <net/pfkeyv2.h>, but on
 * linux it needs to pull in the local hacked up version of the same
 * file (Why?.
 *
 * What this header does not do is include the broken
 * linux/include/libreswan/pfkeyv2.h et.al.  These don't correctly
 * handle optional defintions and extensions.

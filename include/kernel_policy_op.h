 * Declare policy things early enough for uses.
 * Some of these things, while they seem like they are KLIPS-only, the
 * definitions are in fact needed by all kernel interfaces at this time.
 *
 * Flags are encoded above the low-order byte of verbs.
 * "real" eroutes are only outbound.  Inbound eroutes don't exist,
 * but an addflow with an INBOUND flag allows IPIP tunnels to be
 * limited to appropriate source and destination addresses.

 * See: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-schilcher-mobike-pfkey-extension-01
 *
 * This header pulls in all the SADB_* macro and sadb_* struct
 * declarations described by RFC 2368 along with any extensions.
 *
 * But what about divergence?
 *
 * RFC 2367, 1.1 Terminology
 *
 *   In either case, the mandatory-to-implement, or MUST, items MUST
 *   be fully implemented as specified here.  If any mandatory item is
 *   not implemented as specified here, that implementation is not
 *   conforming and not compliant with this specification.
 *
 * RFC 2367, 1.7 Name Spaces:
 *
 *   Inclusion of the file <net/pfkeyv2.h> MUST NOT define symbols or
 *   structures in the PF_KEYv2 name space that are not described in
 *   this document without the explicit prior permission of the
 *   authors.  Any symbols or structures in the PF_KEYv2 name space
 *   that are not described in this document MUST start with "SADB_X_"
 *   or "sadb_x_".
 *
 * Things haven't exactly followed this so some tricks are used to
 * signal this to code using these headers:
 *
 * + implementations have replaced/renamed fields (typically reserved)
 * with new structure members.  When this happens a macro definition
 * of the new name is added.
 *
 * + implementations have (arrrg, and for no obvious reason) completely
 * rewritten some structures.  When this happens things are hacked so
 * that it looks like there's an sadb_x structure available.
 *
 * + implementations define SADB_X_EXT_* macro without defining /
 * using the corresponding sadb_x_ext_* structure.  When this happens
 * the SADB_X_EXT_* macro is undefined.

 * XXX: But why?  Since OpenBSD uses address+mask and not
 * address/prefixlen when specifying child selectors, I'm guessing
 * that the extra seemingly unused fields were simply dropped.
 *
 * The thing is that, even at the time, code was starting to use
 * /prefixlen, and IKEv2 introduced start-end.  The IKEv1 mask was on
 * the way out!
 *
 * The thing is that, even at the time, IKE daemons were using UDP and
 * non-standard ports.  Things this change seems to prohibit.

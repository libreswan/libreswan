/*
 * Many routines return only success or failure, but wish to describe
 * the failure in a message.  We use the convention that they return a
 * NULL on success and a pointer to constant string on failure.  The
 * fact that the string is a constant is limiting, but it avoids
 * storage management issues: the recipient is allowed to assume that
 * the string will live "long enough" (usually forever).
 *
 * XXX: Since the above was written pluto has become multi-threaded
 * so, only when on the main thread, can this be true.

 *
 * ikev2_id / IKEv2 IKE / IKEv2 ESP / IKEv2 AH / IKEv2 DH:
 *
 * Almost no confusion.  While IKEv2 DH uses the the IKEv1
 * OAKLEY_GROUP enum, there are no conflicts so things work.
 *
 * ENCRYPT:  ikev2_trans_type_encr      ikev2_trans_type_encr_names   IKEv2_ENCR
 * PRF:      ikev2_trans_type_prf       ikev2_trans_type_prf_names    IKEv2_AUTH

 * DH:       ike_trans_type_dh          oakley_group_name             OAKLEY
 *
 * ikev1_oakley_id:
 *
 * The only querk here is the use of the HASH (PRF) to select INTEG.
 * The suffix "oakley_id", rather than "ike_id" or "id", is used since
 * it is consistent with the enum values this field contains
 * (apparently IKEv1 IKE (phase 1) is based on the OAKLEY protocol).
 * See ealg_getbyname_ike() and aalg_getbyname_ike().

 * ikev1_esp_id / struct esp_info.transid / struct esp_info.auth:
 *
 * Here be trouble.  While the obvious problem is that struct esp_info
 * is using both IKEv1 (INTEG) and IPSEC (ENCRYPT) enum types, that is
 * of no real importance.  The real issue here is with INTEG where
 * things have badly convoluted IKEv1 and IKEv2 ESP numbers and names.
 * For instance, while the enum ipsec_cipher_algo contains
 * ESP_CAMELLIA=23 (IKEv2), the name table esp_transformid_names
 * returns 22 (IKEv1) for the string "ESP_CAMELLIA".  See
 * ealg_getbyname_esp() and aalg_getbyname_esp().

 *
 * (not yet if ever) ikev[12]_ipsec_id:
 *
 * While these values started out being consistent with IKEv1 and (I
 * suspect) SADB/KLIPS, the've gone off the rails.  Over time they've
 * picked up IKEv2 values making for general confusion.  Worse, as noted above, For instance,
 * CAMELLIA has the IKEv2 value 23 (IKEv1 is 22) resulting in code
 * never being sure if which it is dealing with.
 *
 * These values are not included in this table.
 *
 * ENCRYPT:  ipsec_cipher_algo          esp_transformid_names         ESP
 * INTEG:    ipsec_authentication_algo  ah_transformid_names          AH
 *
 * (not yet if ever) SADB / KLIPS:
 *
 * These values, which I suspect are used to interface with KLIPS,
 * seem to follow the original IKEv1 ESP/AH numbering (which means
 * that they almost but not quite match the mashed up values above).
 *
 * These values are not included in this table
 *
 * ENCRYPT:  sadb_ealg                  ?                             K_SADB*EALG
 * INTEG:    sadb_aalg                  ?                             K_SADB*AALG
 *
 * (not yet if ever) XFRM names:
 *
 * The XFRM interface uses strings to identify algorithms.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * For ESP/AH, since the PRF is not negotiated (the IKE SA's PRF is
 * used) the field "PRF.ikev1_esp_id" should be left blank.  Since,
 * for IKEv2, "PRF.ikev2_id" is used by IKE, it should be defined.
 *
 * XXX: Still missing is a name/alias lookup letting some of alg_info
 * be eliminated.

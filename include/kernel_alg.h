/*
 * This is a database of algorithms supported by the kernel and,
 * hence, can be negotiated for ESP and AH.  For instance, using
 * PF_KEY (rfc2367), it is theoretically possible to query the kernel
 * for supported algorithms and key sizes and use that to populate
 * this database.
 *
 * Of course reality steps in:
 *
 * - there's a race between the kernel loading a crypto module and
 *   this database being populated (suspect it gets populated when the
 *   first connection is initiated?)
 *
 * - there's often a gap between what PF_KEY returns and what the
 *   kernel can support (linux works around this by hardwiring
 *   entries)
 *
 * - there's often a gap between what the PF_KEY headers say is
 *   supported and what the kernel supports (linux works around this
 *   by having pluto local headers)
 *
 * - is there an XFRM way to query what the kernel supports?  I
 *   suspect linux still uses PF_KEY.
 *
 * - while PF_KEY returns key sizes (minbits, maxbits), the
 *   information is ignored and instead the ike_alg DB is consulted
 *   for this information (suspect that while PF_KEY was written to
 *   support variable length keys only fix sized keys have ever been
 *   used - 128 192 256 - and PF_KEY can't describe that
 *

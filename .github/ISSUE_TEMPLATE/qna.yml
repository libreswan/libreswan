        - what is the local machine's Operating System?<br> Please
          include the output from `uname -a`

        - which Liberswan version is the local machine running?<br>
          Please include the output from `ipsec whack --version`.<br>
          You're more likely to get someones attention when the
          problem has been reproduced in the current release

        - is the peer different?<br> If so, please include its
          details.

      description: |

        - what are the host and client addresses?

        - are you using IKEv1 or IKEv2?<br> Since IKEv1 is
          [deprecated](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9395) you're
          more likely to get attention when an IKEv1 problem is also
          demonstrated using IKEv2.  However, we're still interested
          in interop. issues and crashes.

        - are you using ESP or AH, TRANSPORT or TUNNEL mode, IPCOMP,
          IP-TFS?<br> AH has been made obsolete by ESP and NULL
          authentication (the only exception is AH+TRANSPORT).

        - (on Linux) are you using VTI or IPsec Interfaces (XFRMI)?<br>
          If you're using VTI then please try IPsec Interfaces.

        If possible, include `ipsec.conf` (wrapped in markdown's
        tripple backticks)

      description: Please copy and paste the log output
      placeholder: |

        - if possible, start the log at the point where the connection
          is loaded

        - if necessary, remove sensitive details such as addresses and
          certificate IDs<br> but keep as much information as possible

        - please resist the temptation to enable and include debug output<br>
	  _We can't see the forest for the trees_

        - this text will be automatically formatted into code, so no
          need for backticks.

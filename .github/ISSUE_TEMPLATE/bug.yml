        - what is the local machine's Operating System?<br>
          Please include the output from `uname -a`
        - which Liberswan version is the local machine running?<br>
          Please include the output from `ipsec whack --version`.<br>
          You're more likely to get someones attention when the problem has been reproduced in the current release
        - is the peer different?<br>
          If so, please include its details.

      label: Please Describe Your IPsec Configuration
      description: |
        - what are the host and client addresses?
        - are you using IKEv1 or IKEv2?<br>
          Since IKEv1 is [deprecated](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9395) you're more likely to get attention when an IKEv1 problem is also demonstrated using IKEv2.
          However, we're still interested in interop. issues and crashes.
        - are you using ESP or AH, TRANSPORT or TUNNEL mode, IPCOMP, IP-TFS?<br>
          AH has been made obsolete by ESP and NULL authentication (the only exception is AH+TRANSPORT).
        - (on Linux) are you using VTI or IPsec Interfaces (XFRMI)?<br>
          If you're using VTI then please try IPsec Interfaces.

        If possible, include `ipsec.conf` (wrapped in tripple backticks)

      description: Please copy and paste the relevant log output
      placeholder: |
        - if necessary remove sensitive details
          but keep as much information as possible
        - there is no need to include debug output
          most problems are better understood with just the standard logs
        - this will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

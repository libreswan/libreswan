This little tool will convert a Cisco PCF file to an Libreswan style
ipsec.conf connection.

If your PCF file contains an "encrypted" (obfuscated) password, then you
can find the plaintext version by running the Linux Cisco VPN client within
strace. See http://femto.cs.uiuc.edu/~sbond/vpnc/ for more information.

ExecSum: "ltrace -i ./vpnclient connect ... 2>&1 | fgrep 805ac57" to decode
the passwords. (client: vpnclient-linux-4.0.3.B-k9).

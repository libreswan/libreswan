/* generic.h -- anything you don't #undef at the end remains in effect.
   The ONLY things that go in here are generic indicator flags; it's up
   to your programs to declare and call things based on those flags.

   You should only need to make changes via a minimal system-specific section
   at the end of this file.  To build a new section, rip through this and
   check everything it mentions on your platform, and #undef that which needs
   it.  If you generate a system-specific section you didn't find in here,
   please mail me a copy so I can update the "master".

   I realize I'm probably inventing another pseudo-standard here, but
   goddamnit, everybody ELSE has already, and I can't include all of their
   hairball schemes too.  HAVE_xx conforms to the gnu/autoconf usage and
   seems to be the most common format.  In fact, I dug a lot of these out
   of autoconf and tried to common them all together using "stupidh" to
   collect data from platforms.

   In disgust...  _H*  940910, 941115, 950511.  Pseudo-version: 1.3

   Updated 951104 with many patches from netcat feedback, and properly
   closed a lot of slop in open-ended comments: version 1.4
   960217 + nextstep: version 1.5

   randomness about VARARGS??
   --- later stuff to be considered ---
   #define UINT4 ... u-int on alpha/osf, i.e. __alpha/__osf__, ulong elsewhere?
   don't name it that, though, it'll conflict with extant .h files like md5

   randomness about _PATH_WTMP vs WTMP_FILE and where they even live!!

   There's also the issue about WHERE various .h files live, sys/ or otherwise.

# This is a script that can be ADDED to the updown scripts. Normally this would
# be added to /usr/libexec/ipsec/_updown.netkey (for protostack=netkey)
# This is an example that logs XAUTH users to /tmp/terminate.log when the
# tunnel goes down:
#
# Inside _updown.netkey add a call to this script, like:
#
#
#    down-client)
#        # connection to my client subnet going down
#        downrule
#        # If you are doing a custom version, firewall commands go here.

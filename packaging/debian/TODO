Notes about possible future directions in libreswan debian packaging
====================================================================

Service status at package installation
--------------------------------------

libreswan currently ships with an ipsec.service, which is deliberately
not enabled by default, since it is usually meaningless to enable such
a service without manual configuration.  The configuration necessary
is probably too complex to put sanely into debconf.

If an opportunistic/no-configuration-needed mode is functional and
well-tested enough to run without configuration, we may enable the
service by default in future versions.

Integration with non-systemd initsystems
----------------------------------------

The Debian packaging currently only supports integration with systemd.
It looks like upstream's sysvinit support is relatively untested, and
other initsystems are not supported upstream at all.  If anyone wants
to test and help maintain support for alternate initsystems (possibly
in a separate binary package, e.g. libreswan-runit) that would be
welcome!

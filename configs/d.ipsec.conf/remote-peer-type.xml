	Set the remote peer type. This can enable additional processing
	during the IKEv1 negotiation. Acceptable values are
	<option>cisco</option> or <option>ietf</option>
	(the default). When set to cisco, support for Cisco IPsec gateway
	redirection and Cisco obtained DNS and domainname are enabled. This
	includes automatically updating (and restoring) /etc/resolv.conf. These
	options require that XAUTH is also enabled on this connection.

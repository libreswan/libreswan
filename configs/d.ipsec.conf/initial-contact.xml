      whether to send an INITIAL_CONTACT payload to the peer we are
      initiating to, if we currently have no IPsec SAs up with that
      peer.  Acceptable values are: <option>yes</option>
      (the default) and <option>no</option>.  It is
      recommended to leave this option set, unless multiple clients
      with the same identity are expected to connect using the same
      subnets and should operate at the same time. Or if a
      reconnecting client should not delete its old instance (eg
      perhaps it is still running). This is unlikely to be true.

      Whether to perform an additional DNS lookup and confirm the
      remote ID payload with the DNS name in the reverse DNS PTR
      record. Accepted values are <option>no</option>
      (the default) or <option>yes</option>.  This check
      should be enabled when Opportunistic IPsec is enabled in a mode
      that is based on packet triggers (on-demand) using IPSECKEY
      records in DNS. Since in that case the IKE daemon pluto does not
      know the remote ID, it only knows the remote IP address, this
      option forces it to confirm the peer's proposed ID (and thus its
      public/private key) with its actual IP address as listed in the
      DNS. This prevents attacks where mail.example.com's IP address
      is taken over by a neighbour machine with a valid
      web.example.com setup. This check is not needed for certificate
      based Opportunistic IPsec, as "mail.example.com"s certificate
      does not have an entry for "web.example.com". It is also not
      needed for DNS server triggered Opportunistic IPsec, as in that
      case the IKE daemon pluto is informed of both the IP address,
      and the hostname/public key.

      a unique identifier used to match IPsec SAs using iptables with
      XFRM. This identifier is normally automatically allocated in
      groups of 4. It is exported to the _updown script as REQID. On
      Linux, reqids are supported with IP Connection Tracking and NAT
      (iptables). Automatically generated values use the range 16380
      and higher. Manually specified reqid values therefore must be
      between 1 and 16379.
    </para>
    <para>
      Automatically generated reqids use a range of 0-3 (eg 16380-16383 for the
      first reqid). These are used depending on the exact policy (AH, AH+ESP,
      IPCOMP, etc).

      WARNING: Manually assigned reqids are all
      identical. Instantiations of connections (those using %any
      wildcards) will all use the same reqid.  If you use manual
      assigning you should make sure your connections only match
      single road warrior only or you break multiple road warriors
      behind same NAT router because this feature requires unique
      reqids to work.

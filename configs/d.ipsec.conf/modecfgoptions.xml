      When configured as IKEv1 ModeCFG or IKEv2 server, specifying any
      of these options will cause those options and values to be sent
      to the connecting client. Libreswan as a client will use these
      received options to either update /etc/resolv.conf or the
      running unbound DNS server. When the connection is brought down,
      the previous DNS resolving state is restored.

    <para>
      The modecfgdns option takes a comma or space separated list of
      IP addresses that can be used for DNS resolution. The
      modecfgdomains option takes a comma or space separated list of
      internal domain names that are reachable via the supplied
      modecfgdns DNS servers.

      The IKEv1 split tunnel directive will be sent automatically if
      the xauth server side has configured a network other than
      0.0.0.0/0. For IKEv2, this is automated via narrowing.

      Whether or not to enable Extended Sequence Number (ESN) for the
      IPsec SA. This option is only implemented for IKEv2. ESN is
      typically used for very high-speed links (10Gbps or faster)
      where the standard 32 bit sequence number is exhausted too
      quickly, causing IPsec SA's rekeys to happen too often. Accepted
      values are <emphasis remap='B'>either</emphasis> (the default),
      <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> and <emphasis
      remap='B'>no</emphasis>.  If <emphasis
      remap='I'>either</emphasis> is specified as an initiator, the
      responder will make the choice. As a responder, if <emphasis
      remap='I'>either</emphasis> is received, <emphasis
      remap='I'>yes</emphasis> is picked.
    </para>
    <para>
      If replay-window is set to 0, ESN is disabled as some (most?)
      IPsec stacks won't support ESN in such a configuration.

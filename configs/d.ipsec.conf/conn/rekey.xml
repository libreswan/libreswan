      whether a connection should be renegotiated when it is about to
      expire.  The two ends need not agree.  While a value of &no;
      prevents Pluto from requesting renegotiation, it does not
      prevent responding to renegotiation requested from the other
      end, so &no; will be largely ineffective unless both ends agree
      on it.

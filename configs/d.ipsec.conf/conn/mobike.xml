      Whether to allow MOBIKE (RFC 4555) to enable a connection to
      migrate its endpoint without needing to restart the connection
      from scratch. This is used on mobile devices that switch between
      wired, wireless or mobile data connections.  Only connection
      acting as modecfgclient will allow the initiator to migrate
      using mobike. Only connections acting as modecfgserver will
      allow clients to migrate.

      VTI and MOBIKE might not work well when used together.

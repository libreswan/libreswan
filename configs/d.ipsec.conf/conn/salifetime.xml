      encryption/authentication keys for user packets) should last up

      Normally, the connection is renegotiated (via the keying
      channel) before it expires.  The two ends need not exactly agree
      on <option>salifetime</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default is 8 hours (<literal>8h</literal>)).

      The keywords "keylife" and "lifetime" are obsoleted aliases for
      "salifetime."  Change your configs to use "salifetime" instead.

      whether to ignore received DNS configuration.  Normally, when a
      roadwarrior connects to a remote VPN, the remote VPN server
      sends a list of DNS domains and DNS nameserver IP addresses that
      the roadwarrior can use to reach internal only resources through
      the VPN. This option allows the roadwarrior to ignore the
      server's suggestion. The roadwarrior will normally use this
      information to update the DNS resolving process. What is changed
      depends on the detected DNS configuration. It can modify
      /etc/resolv.conf directly, or reconfigure a locally running DNS
      server (unbound, knot, stubby or systemd-resolved) or inform
      NetworkManager.

      NAT Traversal in IKEv1 is negotiated via Vendor ID options as
      specified in RFC 3947.  However, many implementations only
      support the draft version of the RFC. &Libreswan; sends both the
      RFC and the most common draft versions (02, 02_n and 03) to
      maximize interoperability.  Unfortunately, there are known
      broken implementations of RFC 3947, notably Cisco routers that
      have not been updated to the latest firmware. As the NAT-T
      payload is sent in the very first packet of the initiator, there
      is no method to auto-detect this problem and initiate a
      workaround.

      This option allows fine tuning which of the NAT-T payloads to
      consider for sending and processing.  Currently the accepted
      values are <option>drafts</option>, <option>rfc</option>,
      <option>both</option> (the default) and
      <option>none</option>. To interoperate with known broken
      devices, use nat-ikev1-method=drafts.  To prevent the other end
      from triggering IKEv1 NAT-T encapsulation, set this to
      none. This will omit the NAT-T payloads used to determine NAT,
      forcing the other end not to use encapsulation.

      Whether or not the VTI device is shared amongst connections.
      When set to &no;, the VTI device is automatically deleted if the
      connection is a single non-instantiated connection. If a
      connection instantiates (eg right=%any) then this option has no
      effect, as the VTI device is not removed as it is shared with
      multiple roadwarriors.

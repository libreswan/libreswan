      Post-quantum preshared keys (PPKs) to be used.  Currently the
      accepted values are: &propose;, &permit;, or &yes;, signifying
      we allow the of use PPK for this connection; &insist;,
      signifying we allow communication only if PPK is used for key
      derivation; &never; or &no;, signifying that PPK should not be
      used for key derivation.  PPKs can be used in connections that
      allow only IKEv2.  In &Libreswan; that would mean that ikev2
      option must have value &insist;.  This feature is based on RFC
      8784.

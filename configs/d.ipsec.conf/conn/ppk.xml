      EXPERIMENTAL: Post-quantum preshared keys (PPKs) to be
      used. Currently the accepted values are <option>propose</option>
      or <option>yes</option> (the default), signifying we propose to
      use PPK for this connection; <option>insist</option>, signifying
      we allow communication only if PPK is used for key derivation;
      <option>never</option> or <option>no</option>, signifying that
      PPK should not be used for key derivation.  PPKs can be used in
      connections that allow only IKEv2. In libreswan that would mean
      that ikev2 option must have value <option>insist</option>.  This
      feature is based on RFC 8784.

      It is recommended to leave this option unset, unless the remote
      peer (Cisco client or server) requires it. This option does not
      modify local behaviour. It can be needed to connect as a client
      to a Cisco server. It can also be needed to act as a server for
      a Cisco client, which otherwise might send back an error
      DEL_REASON_NON_UNITY_PEER.

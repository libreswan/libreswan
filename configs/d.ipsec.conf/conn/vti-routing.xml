      Whether or not to add network rules or routes for IPsec SA's to
      the respective VTI devices.  When using "routing based VPNs"
      with a subnets policy of <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal>, this
      setting needs to set to &no; to prevent imploding the tunnel,
      and the administrator is expected to manually add ip rules and
      ip routes to configure what traffic must be encrypted.  When set
      to &yes;, the _updown script will automatically route the
      leftsubnet/rightsubnet traffic into the VTI device specified
      with <option>vti-interface</option>
    </para>
    <para>
      The default is &yes;.

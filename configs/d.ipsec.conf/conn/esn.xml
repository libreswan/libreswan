      Whether or not to enable Extended Sequence Number (ESN) for the
      IPsec SA. This option is only implemented for IKEv2. ESN is
      typically used for very high-speed links (10Gbps or faster)
      where the standard 32 bit sequence number is exhausted too
      quickly, causing IPsec SA's rekeys to happen too often.  If
      &either; is specified as an initiator, the responder will make
      the choice.  As a responder, if &either; is received, &yes; is
      picked.

    <para>
      The default is &either;.
    </para>
    <para>
      If replay-window is set to 0, ESN is disabled as some (most?)
      IPsec stacks won't support ESN in such a configuration.

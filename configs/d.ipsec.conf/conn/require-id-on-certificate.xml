      When using certificates, check whether the IKE peer ID is
      present as a subjectAltName (SAN) on the peer
      certificate. Accepted values are <option>yes</option> (the
      default) or <option>no</option>.  This check should only be
      disabled when intentionally using certificates that do not have
      their peer ID specified as a SAN on the certificate. These
      certificates violate RFC 4945 Section 3.1 and are normally
      rejected to prevent a compromised host from assuming the IKE
      identity of another host. The SAN limits the IDs that the peer
      is able to assume.

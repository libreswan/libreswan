    <para>
      Comma separated list of address pools from where the IKEv1 (IPv4
      Mode Config server) and IKEv2 (IPv4 and IPv6 configuration
      payload server) can assign IP addresses to clients.  At most one
      one IPv4 and one IPv6 pool may be specified.  The
      <option>leftaddresspool=</option> option can not be combined
      with with either the <option>leftsubnet=</option> or
      <option>leftsubnets=</option> options.
    </para>
    <para>
      A pool is specified using either an address range (for instance,
      <option>leftaddresspool=192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200</option> or
      CIDR (for instance,
      <option>leftaddresspool=2001:db8:0:3:1::/97)</option> syntax.
      For IPv6, the CIDR syntax has been extended to also allow the
      specification of a subnet, for instance
      <option>leftaddresspool=2001:db8:0:3:1::/60/64</option> will
      allocate <option>/64</option> leases.  While address pools are
      grown as required and leases are reclaimed, the size of an
      address pool should be reasonable.  For instance, the pool
      <option>leftaddresspool=10.0.0.0-11.0.0.0</option> will
      eventually result in an in-memory structure containing 16
      million leases.
    </para>
    <para>
      Address pools specifying the exact same range are shared between
      connections.  Different addresspools cannot partially overlap.

    <para>
      For IKEv1, when <option>right</option> is configured as a server
      using <option>rightxauthserver=&yes;</option>, this option
      specifies the address pool from which IP addresses are taken to
      assign the <option>left</option> clients during the Mode Config
      exchange.  Generally, the <option>leftaddresspool=</option>
      option will be accompanied by
      <option>leftxauthclient=&yes;</option>,
      <option>rightxauthserver=&yes;</option> and
      <option>rightsubnet=0.0.0.0/0</option> option.

      History: &Libreswan; version 3.30 added support for IPv6
      addresses, and replaced a static table with dynamic O(1)
      structures; &Libreswan; 5.0 added support for combined IPv4 and
      IPv6 address pools; &Libreswan; 5.4 added support for IPv6
      subnets.  &Libreswan; should allow the combination of
      <option>addresspool</option> and <option>subnet</option>,
      patches would be welcome.

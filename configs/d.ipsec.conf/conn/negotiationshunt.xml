      What to do with packets during the IKE negotiation.  This should
      almost always be left to the default &hold; value to avoid
      cleartext packet leaking.  The only reason to set this to &pass;
      is if plaintext service availability is more important than
      service security or privacy, a scenario that also implies
      <option>failureshunt=&pass;</option> and most likely
      <option>authby=%null</option> using Opportunistic Encryption.

      Set the method of Network Interface Controller (NIC) hardware
      offload for ESP/AH packet processing.  The value &yes; is a
      backwards compatible value for &crypto;.  The
      <option>nic-offload</option> option is separate from any CPU
      hardware offload available.  When set to &crypto;, only
      cryptographic operations are offloaded to the NIC card.  When
      set to &packet;, the entire packet processing including the
      encryption/decryption is offloaded to the NIC card.

      Crypto NIC-offload is available starting Linux 4.13 using the
      XFRM IPsec stack.  Packet NIC-offload is available starting
      Linux 6.3.  Both require that the Linux kernel is compiled with
      the options CONFIG_XFRM_OFFLOAD, CONFIG_INET_ESP_OFFLOAD and
      CONFIG_INET6_ESP_OFFLOAD.  Network card support can be seen by
      the presence of the <option>esp-hw-offload</option> capability
      using the <command>ethtool -S</command> command.  The Linux
      kernel attempts to fall back from crypto hardware offload to
      software, but only for some algorithms (AEADs only?).  There is
      no fallback from packet offload to crypto offload.  At the time
      of libreswan 5.0, we are only aware of the Nvidia/Mellanox
      ConnectX-7 (and to some extend ConnectX-6) cards supporting
      packet offload.

      In general, it makes no sense to try to offload older (non-AEAD)
      cryptographic algorithms such as AES-CBC or 3DES, as these
      algorithms are so much slower than AEAD algorithms (such as
      AES-GCM) that one would gain more performance by switching the
      algorithm to AEAD than by offloading.  As such, AES-CBC tends to
      not be implemented in offload hardware.  This option has also no
      effect on IKE packets, which are never offloaded, although IKE
      encryption does use supported CPU hardware instructions, such as
      AESNI.

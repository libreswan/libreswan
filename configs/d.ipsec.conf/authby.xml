      how the two security gateways should authenticate each other;
      the default value is <emphasis>rsasig,ecdsa</emphasis>
      which allows ECDSA with SHA-2 and RSA with SHA2 or SHA1. To
      limit this further, there are the options of <emphasis>ecdsa</emphasis>
      for ECDSA digital signatures using
      SHA-2, <emphasis>rsa-sha2</emphasis> for RSASSA-PSS
      digital signatures based authentication with SHA2-256,
      <emphasis>rsa-sha2_384</emphasis> for RSASSA-PSS digital
      signatures based authentication with SHA2-384,
      <emphasis>rsa-sha2_512</emphasis> for RSASSA-PSS digital
      signatures based authentication with SHA2-512, <emphasis>rsa-sha1</emphasis>
      for RSA-PKCSv1.5 digital signatures based authentication with SHA1,
      <emphasis>secret</emphasis> for shared secrets (PSK)
      authentication, <emphasis>secret|rsasig</emphasis> for
      either, <emphasis>never</emphasis> if negotiation is
      never to be attempted or accepted (useful for shunt-only conns),
      and <emphasis>null</emphasis> for null-authentication.
    </para>
    <para>
      If asymmetric authentication is requested, IKEv2 must be
      enabled, and the options <emphasis>leftauth=</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>rightauth=</emphasis> should be used instead of
      authby.
    </para>
    <para>
      For IKEv1, SHA2 based signatures are not defined and ECDSA is
      not implemented, so the default authby= value is rsa-sha1. Using
      authby=rsasig results in only rsa-sha1 as well.  For IKEv2,
      using authby=rsasig means using rsa-sha2_512, rsa-sha2_384,
      rsa-sha2_256 and rsa-sha1, where rsa-sha1 will used only if RFC
      7427 is not supported by the peer.
    </para>
    <para>
      As per RFC 8221, authby=rsa-sha1 is only supported in the old
      style, meaning RSA-PKCSv1.5.  The SHA2 variants are only
      supported for the new style of RFC 7427, so authby=rsa-sha2 will
      use the new style. The default authby= will remove rsa-sha1 in
      the near future. It is strongly recommended that if certificates
      are used, the certificates and the authby= signature methods
      used are the same, as it increases interoperability and keeps
      the authentication of everything within one digital signature
      system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Digital signatures are superior in every way to shared
      secrets. Especially IKEv1 in Aggressive Mode is vulnerable to
      offline dictionary attacks and is performed routinely by at
      least the NSA on monitored internet traffic globally. The never
      option is only used for connections that do not actually start
      an IKE negotiation, such as type=passthrough connections. The
      auth method null is used for "anonymous opportunistic IPsec" and
      should not be used for regular pre-configured IPsec VPNs.

      IKEv2 does not support receiving a plaintext username and
      password.  Libreswan does not yet support EAP authentication
      methods for IKE.  The pam-authorize=yes option performs an
      authorization call via PAM, but only includes the remote ID (not
      username or password). This allows for backends to disallow an
      ID based on non-password situations, such as "user disabled" or
      "user over quota".

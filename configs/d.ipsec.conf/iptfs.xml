Enable "Aggregation and Fragmentation Mode for Encapsulating Security
Payload (ESP) and Its Use for IP Traffic Flow Security (IP-TFS) as
defined in RFC 9347. Currently, this is only supported for the Linux
XFRM stack and will likely be merged into Linux 6.7 or 6.8. Valid
options are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) or
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>. IPTFS allow the kernel to
combine multiple small packets into one ESP packet, which should
cause a performance gain when many small packets (eg iperf packets)
are sent. It also allows the kernel to fragment the outgoing packet
stream so that the ESP packets have a fixed size that can be set
manually or fit the path MTU. This should avoid common MTU issues
with IPsec. IPTFS can only be used with tunnel mode and ESP. It
cannot be combined with type=transport, phase2=ah, compress=yes or
tfc=yes. A number of iptfs options can be tuned.

  <term><emphasis remap='B'>iptfs-max-queue-size</emphasis></term>
  <listitem>
<para>
The default IPTFS max output queue size in octets. The output queue is
where received packets destined for output over an IPTFS tunnel are
stored prior to being output in aggregated/fragmented form over the
IPTFS tunnel. Default 1000000.

  <listitem>
<para>
The default IPTFS drop time in microseconds. The drop time is the amount
of time before a missing out-of-order IPTFS tunnel packet is considered
lost. See also the reorder window. Default is 1s (1000000)

  <listitem>
<para>
The default IPTFS initial output delay in microseconds. The initial
output delay is the amount of time prior to servicing the output queue
after queueing the first packet on said queue. Default 0.

<para>
The default IPTFS reorder window size. The reorder window size dictates
the maximum number of IPTFS tunnel packets in a sequence that may arrive
out of order. Default 3.

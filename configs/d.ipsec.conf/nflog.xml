<para>If set, the NFLOG group number to log <option>this connection's</option> pre-crypt and post-decrypt traffic to.
The default value of <option>0</option> means no logging at all.
This option is only available on linux kernel 2.6.14 and later. It allows common network
utilities such as tcpdump, wireshark and dumpcap, to use nflog:XXX pseudo interfaces where XXX
is the nflog group number. During the updown phase of a connection, iptables will be used to add
and remove the source/destination pair to the nflog group specified. The rules are setup with the
nflog-prefix matching the connection name. See also the global <option>nflog-all</option> option.

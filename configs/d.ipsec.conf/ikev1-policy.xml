What to do with received IKEv1 packets. Valid options are
<emphasis remap='B'>drop</emphasis> (default) which will silently drop
any received IKEv1 packet, <emphasis remap='B'>accept</emphasis>, and
<emphasis remap='B'>reject</emphasis> which will reply with an error.
If this option is set to drop or reject, an attempt to load an
IKEv1 connection will fail, as these connections would never be able to receive a packet
for processing.

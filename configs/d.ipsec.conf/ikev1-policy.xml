      What to do with received IKEv1 packets. Valid options are
      <emphasis remap='B'>drop</emphasis> (default) which will
      silently drop any received IKEv1 packet, <emphasis
      remap='B'>accept</emphasis>, and <emphasis
      remap='B'>reject</emphasis> which will reply with an error.  If
      this option is set to drop or reject, an attempt to load an
      IKEv1 connection will fail, as these connections would never be
      able to receive a packet for processing.

What to do with received IKEv1 packets. Valid options are
<emphasis remap='B'>accept</emphasis> (default), <emphasis remap='B'>reject</emphasis> which
will reply with an error, and <emphasis remap='B'>drop</emphasis> which will silently drop
any received IKEv1 packet. If this option is set to drop or reject, an attempt to load an
IKEv1 connection will fail, as these connections would never be able to receive a packet
for processing.

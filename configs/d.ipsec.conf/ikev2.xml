  <listitem>
<para>Whether to use IKEv1 (RFC 4301) or IKEv2 (RFC 7296) settings to be used.
Currently the accepted values are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>(the default),
signifying only IKEv1 is accepted, or <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>,
signifying only IKEv2 is accepted. Previous versions allowed the keywords
<emphasis remap='B'>propose</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>permit</emphasis>
that would allow either IKEv1 or IKEv2, but this is no longer supported. The
permit option is interpreted as no and the propose option is interpreted as
yes. Older versions also supported keyword
<emphasis remap='B'>insist</emphasis> which is now interpreted as yes.

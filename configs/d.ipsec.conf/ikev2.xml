      Whether to use IKEv2 (RFC 7296) or IKEv1 (RFC 4301).  Currently
      the accepted values are <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> (the
      default), signifying only IKEv2 is accepted, or <emphasis
      remap='B'>no</emphasis>, signifying only IKEv1 is
      accepted. Previous versions allowed the keywords <emphasis
      remap='B'>propose</emphasis> or <emphasis
      remap='B'>permit</emphasis> that would allow either IKEv1 or
      IKEv2, but this is no longer supported. The permit option is
      interpreted as no and the propose option is interpreted as
      yes. Older versions also supported keyword <emphasis
      remap='B'>insist</emphasis> which is now interpreted as yes.

      The default ESP hash truncation for sha2_256 is 128 bits. Some
      IPsec implementations (Linux before 2.6.33, some Cisco (2811?)
      routers) implement the draft version which stated 96 bits. If a
      draft implementation communicates with an RFC implementation,
      both ends will reject encrypted packets from each other.

      This option enables using the draft 96 bits version to interop
      with those implementations.  Currently the accepted values are
      <option>no</option>, (the default) signifying default RFC
      truncation of 128 bits, or <option>yes</option>, signifying the
      draft 96 bits truncation.

      Another workaround is to switch from sha2_256 to sha2_128 or
      sha2_512.

<para>Left is an XAUTH client. The xauth connection will have to be
started interactively and cannot be configured using
<option>auto=start</option>.  Instead, it has to be started from
the commandline using <command>ipsec up
<replaceable>connection</replaceable></command>.  You will then be
prompted for the username and password. To setup an XAUTH connection
non-interactively, which defeats the whole purpose of XAUTH, but is
regularly requested by users, it is possible to use a whack command -
<command>ipsec whack --name baduser --ipsecgroup-xauth --xauthname
badusername --xauthpass password --initiate</command> The other side
of the connection should be configured as
<option>rightxauthserver</option>.  Acceptable values are
<option>yes</option> or <option>no</option> (the
default).</para>

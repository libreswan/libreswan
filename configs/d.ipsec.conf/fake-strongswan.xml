      whether to send a STRONGSWAN Vendor ID payload to the peer.
      Acceptable values are: <option>no</option> (the
      default) and <option>yes</option>. Strongswan enables some
      non-standard features and private algorithms only when it detects
      the strongswan Vendor ID. The exact capabilities depend on the
      strongswan version. At the time of writing this entry this option
      can enable negotiation of BEET mode (until the IETF assigns a
      code point), enable some private algorithms (eg some experimental
      post-quantum algorithms) and eanbles forwarding RADIUS attributes
      (which should not have any affects with the current EAP support
      in libreswan). Note that experimental algorithms on strongswan
      can also be enabled using charon.accept_private_algs and then this
      option is not needed.

      The time in seconds until the XFRM acquire state times out. The
      default value is 30 seconds.  For auto=ondemand connections and
      Opportunistic connections an IPsec policy is installed in the
      kernel. If an incoming or outgoing packet matches this policy, a
      state is created in the kernel and the kernel sends an ACQUIRE
      message to the IKE daemon pluto. While this state is in place,
      no new acquires will come in for this connection. The default
      should be fine for most people.  One use case of shortening
      these is if opportunistc encryption is used towards cloud
      instances that can quickly re-use IP addresses. This value is
      only used during the libreswan startup process by the ipsec
      _stackmanager helper. See also <option>failureshunt</option> and

      What to do with packets during the IKE negotiation.  Valid
      options are <option>hold</option> (the default) or
      <option>pass</option>. This should almost always be left to the
      default <option>hold</option> value to avoid cleartext packet
      leaking. The only reason to set this to <option>pass</option> is
      if plaintext service availability is more important than service
      security or privacy, a scenario that also implies
      <option>failureshunt=pass</option> and most likely
      <option>authby=%null</option> using Opportunistic Encryption.

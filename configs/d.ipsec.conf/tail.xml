    CHOOSING A CONNECTION [THIS SECTION IS EXTREMELY OUT OF DATE
  </title>
  <para>
    When choosing a connection to apply to an outbound packet caught
    with a <emphasis remap='B'>%trap,</emphasis> the system prefers
    the one with the most specific eroute that includes the packet's
    source and destination IP addresses.  Source subnets are examined
    before destination subnets.  For initiating, only routed
    connections are considered. For responding, unrouted but added
    connections are considered.
  </para>
  <para>
    When choosing a connection to use to respond to a negotiation
    that doesn't match an ordinary conn, an opportunistic connection may
    be instantiated. Eventually, its instance will be /32 -&gt; /32, but
    for earlier stages of the negotiation, there will not be enough
    information about the client subnets to complete the
    instantiation.

    version of Libreswan.

  <para>
    When <emphasis remap='B'>type</emphasis> or <emphasis
    remap='B'>failureshunt</emphasis> is set to <emphasis
    remap='B'>drop</emphasis> or <emphasis
    remap='B'>reject,</emphasis> Libreswan blocks outbound packets
    using eroutes, but assumes inbound blocking is handled by the
    firewall. Libreswan offers firewall hooks via an
    &ldquo;updown&rdquo; script.  However, the default <emphasis
    remap='B'>ipsec _updown</emphasis> provides no help in controlling
    a modern firewall.
  </para>

  <para>
    Including attributes of the keying channel (authentication
    methods, <emphasis remap='B'>ikelifetime</emphasis>, etc.) as an
    attribute of a connection, rather than of a participant pair, is
    dubious and incurs limitations.
  </para>

  <para>
    The use of <emphasis remap='B'>%any</emphasis> with the <emphasis
    remap='I'>protoport=</emphasis> option is ambiguous. Should the SA
    permits any port through or should the SA negotiate any single
    port through?  The first is a basic conn with a wildcard. The
    second is a template. The second is the current behaviour, and
    it's wrong for quite a number of uses involving TCP. The keyword
    <emphasis remap='B'>%one</emphasis> may be introduced in the
    future to separate these two cases.
  </para>

  <para>
    It would be good to have a line-continuation syntax, especially
    for the very long lines involved in RSA signature keys.
  </para>

  <para>
    The ability to specify different identities, <emphasis
    remap='B'>authby</emphasis>, and public keys for different
    automatic-keyed connections between the same participants is
    misleading; this doesn't work dependably because the identity of
    the participants is not known early enough.  This is especially
    awkward for the &ldquo;Road Warrior&rdquo; case, where the remote
    IP address is specified as <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>, and that is
    considered to be the &ldquo;participant&rdquo; for such
    connections.
  </para>

  <para>
    If conns are to be added before DNS is available, <emphasis
    remap='B'>left=</emphasis><emphasis remap='I'>FQDN</emphasis>,
    <emphasis remap='B'>leftnextop=</emphasis><emphasis
    remap='I'>FQDN</emphasis>, and <emphasis
    remap='B'>leftrsasigkey=%dnsonload</emphasis> will fail.
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_pluto</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    does not actually use the public key for our side of a conn but it
    isn't generally known at a add-time which side is ours (Road
    Warrior and Opportunistic conns are currently exceptions).

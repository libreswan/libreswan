<para>whether to ignore received DNS configuration.
Acceptable values are: <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.
Normally, when a roadwarrior connects to a remote VPN, the remote VPN
server sends a list of DNS domains and DNS nameserver IP addresses
that the roadwarrior can use to reach internal only resources through
the VPN. This option allows the roadwarrior to ignore the server's
suggestion. The roadwarrior will normally use this information to update
the DNS resolving process. What is changed depends on the detected DNS
configuration. It can modify /etc/resolv.conf directly, or reconfigure
a locally running DNS server (unbound, knot, stubby or systemd-resolved)
or inform NetworkManager.

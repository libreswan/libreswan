    <para>
      The priority in the kernel SPD/SAD database, when matching up
      packets.  Each kernel (XFRM, OSX, etc) has its own mechanism
      for setting the priority. Setting this option to non-zero
      passes the priority to the kernel stack unmodified. The
      maximum value depends on the stack. It is recommended not to
      exceed 65536
    </para>
    <para>
      XFRM use a priority system based on "most specific match
      first". It uses an internal algorithm to calculate these based
      on network prefix length, protocol and port selectors. A lower
      value means a higher priority.

    <para>
      Typical values are about the 2000 range. These can be seen on
      the XFRM stack using <option>ip xfrm policy</option> when the
      connection is up.  For "anonymous IPsec" or Opportunistic
      Encryption based connections, a much lower priority (65535) is
      used to ensure administrator configured IPsec always takes
      precedence over opportunistic IPsec.

<para>This option configures when Libreswan will send X.509 certificates to the remote
host. Acceptable values are
<option>yes|always</option>
(signifying that we should always send a certificate),
<option>sendifasked</option>
(signifying that we should send a certificate if the remote end asks for it), and
<option>no|never</option>
(signifying that we will never send a X.509 certificate).
The default for this option is
<option>sendifasked</option>
which may break compatibility with other vendor's IPsec implementations, such as
Cisco and SafeNet. If you find that you are getting errors about no ID/Key found,
you likely need to set this to
<option>always</option>.
This per-conn option replaces the obsolete global <option>nocrsend</option>
option.

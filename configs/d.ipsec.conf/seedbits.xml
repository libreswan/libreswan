      Pluto uses the NSS crypto library as its random source. Some
      government Three Letter Agencies require that pluto reads
      additional bits from /dev/random and feed these into the NSS RNG
      before drawing random from the NSS library, despite the NSS
      library itself already seeding its internal state. This process
      can block pluto for an extended time during startup, depending
      on the entropy of the system. Therefore, the default is to not
      perform this redundant seeding. If specifying a value, it is
      recommended to specify at least 460 bits (for FIPS) or 440 bits
      (for BSI).

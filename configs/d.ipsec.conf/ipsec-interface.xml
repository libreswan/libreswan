Create or use an existing virtual interface <emphasis remap='I'>ipsecXXX</emphasis> for "Routing
based VPNs" (as opposed to "Policy based VPNs"). Valid options are <emphasis remap='I'>yes</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>no</emphasis> or a number. When using a number, the IPsec interface created
and/or used will use that number as part of the interface name. For example setting
<emphasis remap='I'>ipsec-interface=5</emphasis> will create and/or use the <emphasis>ipsec5</emphasis>
interface. The value <emphasis remap='I'>0</emphasis> cannot be used and is interpreted as
<emphasis remap='I'>no</emphasis>. The value <emphasis remap='I'>yes</emphasis> is interpreted as the
number 1, and thus will use the interface named <emphasis>ipsec1</emphasis>. An IP address can be
configured for this interface via the <emphasis remap='I'>interface-ip=</emphasis> option.

<para>
The ipsec-interface is used to route outbound traffic that needs to be encrypted, and will decrypt
inbound traffic that arrives on this interface. All traffic that is routed to this interface will
be automatically encrypted providing the IPsec SA policy covers this traffic. Traffic not matching
the IPsec SA will be dropped. Tools such as tcpdump, iptables, ifconfig and tools that need traffic
counters can be used on all cleartext pre-encrypt and post-decrypt traffic on the device. When
<emphasis remap='I'>leftsubnet=</emphasis> is equal to <emphasis remap='I'>rightsubnet=</emphasis>,
the routing needs to be manged by an external routing daemon or manually by the administrator.

<para>
This option is currently only supported on Linux kernels 4.19 or later when compiled with XFRMi support
(<emphasis>CONFIG_XFRM_INTERFACE</emphasis>). The number of the ipsecX device corresponds with the
<emphasis>XFRM IF_ID</emphasis> policy option of the IPsec SA in the Linux kernel. On Linux, XFRMi
interfaces can be managed by libreswan automatically or can be preconfigured on the system using
the existing init system or via networking tools such as systemd-networkd and NetworkManager. The
_updown script handles certain Linux specific interfaces settings required for proper functioning,
such as forwarding and routing rules for IPsec traffic.

<para>
The ipsec-interface=0 will create an interface with the same name as the old KLIPS interface, ipsec0.
This interface name should only be used when required for migration from KLIPS to XFRM interfaces.
Since XFRM IF_ID and marking cannot use 0, this is mapped to 16384. This means that the
devices ipsec0 and ipsec16384 cannot both be in use.

<para>
The IP address and netmask to configure on a virtual device (eg ipsecXXX). This is often
used when building Routing based IPsec tunnels using transport mode and GRE, but can also be useful in
other scenarios. Currently requires <emphasis remap='I'>ipsec-interface=</emphasis>. See also
<emphasis remap='I'>leftvti=</emphasis> for cnofiguring IP addresses when using VTI.

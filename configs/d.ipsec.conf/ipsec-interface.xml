      Specify the IPsec Interface for "Routing based IPsec VPNs" (as
      opposed to "Policy based VPNs").  The IPsec Interface is used to
      route outbound traffic that needs to be encrypted, and will
      decrypt inbound traffic that arrives on this interface.  All
      traffic that is routed to this interface will be automatically
      encrypted providing the IPsec SA policy covers this traffic.
      Traffic not matching the IPsec SA will be dropped.  Tools such
      as <command>tcpdump</command>, <command>iptables</command>,
      <command>ifconfig</command> and tools that need traffic counters
      can be used on all cleartext pre-encrypt and post-decrypt
      traffic on the device.  When <option>leftsubnet=</option> is
      equal to <option>rightsubnet=</option>, the routing needs to be
      managed by an external routing daemon or manually by the
      administrator.

      By default, &Libreswan; is configured in managed mode.  In
      managed mode, &Libreswan; will create, configure
      <option>up</option>, <option>down</option>, and delete the IPsec
      Interface device (on &Linux;, &FreeBSD;, and &NetBSD; that
      device is named <option>ipsec</option>; &OpenBSD; it is named
      <option>sec</option>).  To specify the IP address to configure
      when creating the device also specify
      <option>interface-ip=</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Alternatively, &Libreswan; can be configured in unmanaged mode.
      In unmanaged mode, &Libreswan; does not manipulate the IPsec
      Interface Device directly.  Instead &Libreswan; will assume the
      IPsec Interface device already exists, manipulating it directly
      using the low-level kernel ID (on &Linux; that is the XFRMi
      if_id).  A typical use is with namespaces where the IPsec
      Interface Device and &Libreswan; are in separate namespace.

	    This option is currently only supported on Linux kernels
	    when compiled with XFRMi support
	    (<option>CONFIG_XFRM_INTERFACE</option>).  The number of
	    the ipsecX device corresponds with the <option>XFRM
	    IF_ID</option> policy option of the IPsec SA in the Linux
	    kernel. On Linux, XFRMi interfaces can be managed by
	    &Libreswan; automatically or can be preconfigured on the
	    system using the existing init system or via networking
	    tools such as systemd-networkd and NetworkManager. The
	    _updown script handles certain Linux specific interfaces
	    settings required for proper functioning, such as
	    forwarding and routing rules for IPsec traffic.

      The startup mode of the DDoS defense mechanism.  This option can
      also be given to the IKE daemon while running, for example by
      issuing <command>ipsec whack --ddos--busy</command>.  When in
      &busy; mode, pluto activates anti-DDoS counter measures.
      Currently, counter measures consist of requiring IKEv2 anti-DDoS
      cookies on new incoming IKE requests, and a more aggressive
      cleanup of partially established or AUTH_NULL connections.

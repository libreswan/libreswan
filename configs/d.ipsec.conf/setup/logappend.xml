      When pluto is logging to a file, as specified by
      <option>logfile=</option>, open the log file in append mode or
      truncate mode.  Since, on modern systems, &pluto; is restarted
      by other daemons, such as &systemd;, this option should be left
      as its default, <option>yes</option>, to preserve the log
      entries of previous runs of &pluto;.

      This option is mainly intended for developers when running the
      test suite, which needs to create new log files from scratch.

      Prior to &Libreswan; version 5.3 &pluto;, when invoked without a
      config file, would set this option to <option>no</option>.

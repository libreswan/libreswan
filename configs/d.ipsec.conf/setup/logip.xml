       If pluto is instructed to log the IP address of incoming
       connections.  Valid options are <option>yes</option> (the
       default) and <option>no</option>. Note that this only affects
       regular logging. Any enabled debugging via
       <option>plutodebug=</option> will still contain IP addresses of
       peers. This option is mostly meant for servers that want to
       avoid logging IP addresses of incoming clients. Other
       identifiable information might still be logged, such as ID
       payloads and X.509 certificate details. When using ID of type
       IP address, this option will not hide the actual IP address as
       part of the ID. Most deployments will not want to change this
       from the default.  If logging of IP addresses is unwanted,
       <option>audit-log=no</option> should also be set.

      how many <option>pluto helpers</option> are started to help with
      cryptographic operations. Pluto will start as many helpers as
      the number of CPU's, minus 1 to dedicate to the main thread.
      For machines with less than 4 CPU's, an equal number of helpers
      to CPU's are started.  A value of 0 forces pluto to do all
      operations inline using the main process. A value of -1 tells
      pluto to perform the above calculation. Any other value forces
      the number to that amount.

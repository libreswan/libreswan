      if not set, &pluto; is tolerant about missing or expired &X.509;
      Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL's), and will allow peer
      certificates as long as they do not appear on an expired CRL.
      When this option is enabled, all connections with an expired or
      missing CRL will be denied.  Active connections will be
      terminated at rekey time.  This setup is more secure, but
      vulnerable to downtime if the CRL expires.

      The time until bare shunts (kernel policies not associated with
      connections) are deleted from the kernel.  When using
      Opportunistic Encryption to a specific host fails, the system
      will either install a %pass or %hold shunt to let the traffic
      out clear text or block it. During the the shuntlifetime, no new
      Opportunistic Encryption attempt will be started, although the
      system will still respond to incoming OE requests from the
      remote IP. See also <option>failureshunt</option> and

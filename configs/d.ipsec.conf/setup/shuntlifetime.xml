      The time until bare shunts (kernel policies not associated with
      connections) are deleted from the kernel. The default value is
      15m. When using Opportunistic Encryption to a specific host
      fails, the system will either install a %pass or %hold shunt to
      let the traffic out clear text or block it. During the the
      shuntlifetime, no new Opportunistic Encryption attempt will be
      started, although the system will still respond to incoming OE
      requests from the remote IP. See also

      The HTTP methods used for fetching OCSP data.  Note that this
      behaviour depends on the NSS crypto library that is actually
      performing the fetching. When set to the &get; method, post is
      attempted only as fallback in case of failure. When set to &post;,
      only the post method is ever used.

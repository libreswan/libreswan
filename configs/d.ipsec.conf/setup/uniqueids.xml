    <para>
      Whether IDs should be considered identifying remote parties
      uniquely.  Participant IDs normally are unique, so a new
      connection instance using the same remote ID is almost
      invariably intended to replace an old existing connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the connection is defined to be a server (using
      <option>xauthserver=</option>) and the connection policy is
      <option>authby=secret</option>, this option is ignored (as of
      3.20) and old connections will never be replaced.  This
      situation is commonly known as clients using a "Group ID".
    </para>
    <para>
      This option may disappear in the near future.  People using
      identical X.509 certificates on multiple devices are urged to
      upgrade to use separate certificates per client and device.

      The default is &yes;.

      Prior to &Libreswan; version 5.3, when &pluto; was started
      directly and without a configuration file, this option was set
      to <literal>no</literal>.

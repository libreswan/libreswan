      If set, the NFLOG group number to log all pre-crypt and
      post-decrypt traffic to.  The value <literal>0</literal> means
      no logging at all.  This option is only available on linux
      kernel 2.6.14 and later. It allows common network utilities such
      as tcpdump, wireshark and dumpcap, to use nflog:XXX pseudo
      interfaces where XXX is the nflog group number. During startup
      and shutdown of the IPsec service, iptables commands will be
      used to add or remove the global NFLOG table rules. The rules
      are setup with the nflog-prefix <option>all-ipsec</option>. See
      also the per-connection <option>nflog</option> option.

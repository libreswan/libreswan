      If set, the NFLOG group number to log <option>all</option>
      pre-crypt and post-decrypt traffic to.  The default value of
      <option>0</option> means no logging at all.  This option is only
      available on linux kernel 2.6.14 and later. It allows common
      network utilities such as tcpdump, wireshark and dumpcap, to use
      nflog:XXX pseudo interfaces where XXX is the nflog group
      number. During startup and shutdown of the IPsec service,
      iptables commands will be used to add or remove the global NFLOG
      table rules. The rules are setup with the nflog-prefix
      <option>all-ipsec</option>. See also the per-connection
      <option>nflog</option> option.

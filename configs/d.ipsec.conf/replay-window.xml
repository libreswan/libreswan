      The size of the IPsec SA replay window protection in packets.
      Kernels (Linux, and most BSDs) support a window size of at least
      2040 packets.  The default replay window size is 128 packets.

      A value of 0 disables replay protection.  Disabling of replay
      protection is sometimes used on a pair of IPsec servers in a
      High Availability setup, or on servers with very unpredictable
      latency, such as mobile networks, which can cause an excessive
      amount of out of order packets.

      Disabling replay protection will also disable Extended Sequence
      Numbers (esn=no), as advise from RFC 4303 caused some stacks to
      not support ESN without a replay-window.

      Note: on Linux, sequence errors can be seen in
      /proc/net/xfrm_stat.

      Note: the BSD <option>setkey</option> utility displays the
      replay window size in bytes (8 packets per byte) and not
      packets.

      Technically, at least the Linux kernel can install IPsec SA's
      with an IPsec SA Sequence Number, but this is currently not
      supported by libreswan.

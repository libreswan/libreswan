      How the security gateways will authenticate to the other side in
      the case of asymmetric authentication; acceptable values are
      <option>rsasig</option> or <option>rsa</option>
      for RSA Authentication with SHA-1, <option>rsa-sha2</option>
      for RSA-PSS digital signatures based authentication with SHA2-256,
      <option>rsa-sha2_384</option> for RSA-PSS digital signatures
      based authentication with SHA2-384, <option>rsa-sha2_512</option>
      for RSA-PSS digital signatures based authentication with SHA2-512,
      <option>ecdsa</option> for ECDSA digital signatures based
      authentication, <option>secret</option> for shared
      secrets (PSK) authentication and <option>null</option> for
      null-authentication. There is no default value - if unset, the
      symmetrical <option>authby=</option> keyword is used to
      determine the authentication policy of the connection.
    </para>

    <para>
      Asymmetric authentication is only supported with IKEv2. If symmetric
      authentication is required, use <option>authby=</option> instead
      of leftauth and rightauth. If leftauth is set, rightauth must also be set and
      authby= must not be set. Asymmetric authentication cannot use secret (psk) on one
      side and null on the other side - use psk on both ends instead.
    </para>
    <para>
      When using EAPONLY authentication, which omits the regular IKEv2
      AUTH payload, leftauth= (or rightauth=) should be set to
      <option>eaponly</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Be aware that the symmetric keyword is <option>authby=</option>
      but the asymmetric keyword is <option>leftauth</option> and
      <option>rightauth</option> (without the "by").

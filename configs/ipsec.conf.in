config setup
	# If logfile= is unset, syslog is used to send log messages too.
	# Note that on busy VPN servers, the amount of logging can trigger
	# syslogd (or journald) to rate limit messages.
	#logfile=@@LOGDIR@@/pluto.log

	# Debugging should only be used to find bugs, not configuration issues!
	# "base" regular debug, "tmi" is excessive (!) and "private" will log
	# sensitive key material (not available in FIPS mode). The "cpu-usage"
	# value logs timing information and should not be used with other
	# debug options as it will defeat getting accurate timing information.
	# Default is "none"
	# plutodebug="base"
	# plutodebug="tmi"
	#plutodebug="none"

	# Whether to log IP addresses of incoming connections. Disable when
	# logfile privacy is required.
	#logip=yes

	# The startup mode of the DDoS defense mechanism. Acceptable values
	# are busy, unlimited or auto (the default). This option can also be
	# given to the IKE daemon while running, for example by issuing ipsec
	# whack --ddos--busy. When in busy mode, pluto activates the IKEv2
	# anti-DDoS # counter measures.
	#ddos-mode=auto

	# DDoS defense mechanism threshold
	# The number of half-open IKE SAs before the pluto IKE daemon will be
	# placed in (anti-ddos) busy mode. The default is 25000.

	# IKEv1 policy (accept, reject or drop)
	# See RFC 9395 - Deprecation of IKEv1 and obsoleted algorithms
	#ikev1-policy=drop

	# IKEv2 global redirect (during IKE_SA_INIT)
	# Whether to send requests for the remote peer to redirect IKE/IPsec
	# SA's during IKE_SA_INIT. Valid options are no (the default), yes
	# and auto, where auto means that the requests will be sent if DDoS
	# mode is active (see ddos-mode). If set, the option
	# global-redirect-to= must also be set to indicate where to redirect
	# peers to. this can be given to the IKE daemon while running using
	# ipsec whack --global-redirect{-to}
	#global-redirect=no
	#global-redirect-to=<ip or hostname>, ...

	# The number of half-open IKE SAs before the IKE daemon starts
	# refusing all new IKE attempts. Established IKE peers are not
	# affected.
	#max-halfopen-ike=5000

	# Whether pluto performs DNSSEC validation.
	#dnssec-enable=yes

	# To accept IKE and IPsec encapsulation over TCP. Requires at least
	# Linux 5.7 kernel or a kernel with TCP backport (like RHEL8 4.18.0-291)
	# To enable IKE and IPsec over TCP for VPN client, also specify
	# tcp-remote-port=4500 in the client's conn section.
	#listen-tcp=no

	# SECCOMP syscall filtering (enabled,disabled or tolerant)
	# Whether to log (when tolerant) or restart (when enabled) when
	# a rogue syscall is attempted by pluto indicating a remote code
	# exploit attempt.  # If using custom _updown scripts, this might
	# trigger false positives.
	#seccomp=disabled

# if it exists, include system wide crypto-policy defaults
# include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config

# It is best to add your IPsec connections as separate files
# in @@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@@/
include @@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@@/*.conf

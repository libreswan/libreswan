config setup
	# If logfile= is unset, syslog is used to send log messages too.
	# Note that on busy VPN servers, the amount of logging can trigger
	# syslogd (or journald) to rate limit messages.

	#
	# Debugging should only be used to find bugs, not configuration issues!
	# "base" regular debug, "tmi" is excessive (!) and "private" will log
	# sensitive key material (not available in FIPS mode). The "cpu-usage"
	# value logs timing information and should not be used with other
	# debug options as it will defeat getting accurate timing information.
	# Default is "none"
	# plutodebug="base"
	# plutodebug="tmi"
	#plutodebug="none"
	#
	# Some machines use a DNS resolver on localhost with broken DNSSEC
	# support. This can be tested using the command:
	# dig +dnssec DNSnameOfRemoteServer
	# If that fails but omitting '+dnssec' works, the system's resolver is
	# broken and you might need to disable DNSSEC.
	# dnssec-enable=no
	#
	# To enable IKE and IPsec over TCP for VPN server. Requires at least
	# Linux 5.7 kernel or a kernel with TCP backport (like RHEL8 4.18.0-291)
	# listen-tcp=yes
	# To enable IKE and IPsec over TCP for VPN client, also specify
	# tcp-remote-port=4500 in the client's conn section.

# if it exists, include system wide crypto-policy defaults
# include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config

# It is best to add your IPsec connections as separate files
# in @IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/
include @IPSEC_CONFDDIR@/*.conf

# "uname" describes the the build system's kernel, and not the target
# system's operating environment (architecture, kernel, operating
# system version, glibc version, ...) - think cross compile.
#
# An improvement might be:
#
#   $(CC) -dumpmachine
#
# but this assumes CC has already been set (currently CC can be set
# later, via Makefile.inc, by packaging/defaults/$(BUILDENV) and/or
# packaging/defaults/$(BUILDENV).$(ARCH)
#
# Trying to query the build environment with tricks like:
#
# ( echo '#include <features.h>' ; echo 'major=__GLIBC__ ;
# minor=__GLIBC_MINOR__') | gcc -E -
#
# have a similar result.

# supply kernel-configuration ARCH defaults

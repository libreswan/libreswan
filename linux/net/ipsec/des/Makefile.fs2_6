# The assembly version is incompatible with CONFIG_REGPARM=y The
# CONFIG_REGPARM defines whether it uses registers or stack to pass
# arguments and recent kernels (after 2.6.17 or 2.6.18) uses registers
# unconditionally. Therefore, we disable the assembly version for ix86's
# completely.
# #
# the assembly version expects frame pointers, which are
# optional in many kernel builds. If you want speed, you should
# probably use cryptoapi code instead.

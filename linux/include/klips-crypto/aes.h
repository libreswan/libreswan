// This is an implementation of the AES encryption algorithm (Rijndael)
// designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. This version is designed
// to provide both fixed and dynamic block and key lengths and can also
// run with either big or little endian internal byte order (see aes.h).
// It inputs block and key lengths in bytes with the legal values being
// 16, 24 and 32.

/*
 * Modified by Jari Ruusu,  May 1 2001
 *  - Fixed some compile warnings, code was ok but gcc warned anyway.
 *  - Changed basic types: byte -> unsigned char, word -> u_int32_t
 *  - Major name space cleanup: Names visible to outside now begin
 *    with "aes_" or "AES_". A lot of stuff moved from aes.h to aes.c
 *  - Removed C++ and DLL support as part of name space cleanup.
 *  - Eliminated unnecessary recomputation of tables. (actual bug fix)
 *  - Merged precomputed constant tables to aes.c file.
 *  - Removed data alignment restrictions for portability reasons.
 *  - Made block and key lengths accept bit count (128/192/256)
 *    as well byte count (16/24/32).
 *  - Removed all error checks. This change also eliminated the need
 *    to preinitialize the context struct to zero.
 *  - Removed some totally unused constants.

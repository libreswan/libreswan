Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon
 Libreswan is an IPsec implementation for Linux. It has support for most 
 of the extensions (RFC + IETF drafts) related to IPsec, including 
 IKEv2, X.509 Digital Certificates, NAT Traversal, and many others.
 .
 Libreswan has been forked from Openswan 2.6.38, which was forked from
 FreeS/WAN 1.99.
 .
 The Libreswan IKE daemon is named pluto. It was inherited from the FreeS/WAN
 project, but provides improved X.509 certificate support and other features.
 .
 In order to use the KLIPS IPsec code instead of the native version, you will
 need to either install libreswan-modules-source and build the appropriate
 module for your kernel or use libreswan-modules-dkms which automates this
 task.

Package: libreswan-dbg
Architecture: any
Section: debug
Priority: extra
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libreswan (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon - debugging symbols
 Libreswan is an IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It can use the
 native IPsec stack as well as the KLIPS kernel module. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2
 protocols are supported.
 .
 This package provides the symbols needed for debugging of libreswan
 binaries.

Package: libreswan-doc
Architecture: all
Section: doc
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon - documentation
 Libreswan is an IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It can use the
 native IPsec stack as well as the KLIPS kernel module. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2
 protocols are supported.
 .
 This package provides the free parts of the documentation for Libreswan.

Package: libreswan-modules-source
Architecture: all
Section: kernel
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, debhelper, bzip2
Recommends: module-assistant | kernel-package, linux-headers | linux-source
Suggests: libreswan
Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon - kernel module source
 Libreswan is an IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It can use the
 native IPsec stack as well as the KLIPS kernel module. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2
 protocols are supported.
 .
 For support of the old-style KLIPS ipsecX network interfaces a custom
 kernel module is needed.
 .
 This package contains source code for the Libreswan IPsec kernel module,
 which can be used with tools like module-assistant or kernel-package
 for manual building of local kernel images.
 .
 Kernel versions >= 2.6.23 no longer need to be patched to provide NAT
 Traversal support for KLIPS.

Package: libreswan-modules-dkms
Architecture: any
Section: kernel
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, dkms, libreswan
Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon - DKMS source
 Libreswan is an IPsec based VPN solution for the Linux kernel. It can use the
 native IPsec stack as well as the KLIPS kernel module. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2
 protocols are supported.
 .
 For support of the old-style KLIPS ipsecX network interfaces a custom
 kernel module is needed.
 .
 This package contains source code for the Libreswan IPsec kernel module,
 which can be used with DKMS so that local kernel images are automatically
 built and installed every time relevant kernel packages are upgraded.
 .
 Kernel versions >= 2.6.23 no longer need to be patched to provide NAT
 Traversal support for KLIPS.
